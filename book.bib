  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treated aneurysms must be followed over time to ensure durable occlusion, as more than 20\% of endovascularly treated aneurysms recur. While digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is attractive as a non-invasive follow-up technique. Two different MRA techniques have traditionally been used: time-of-flight (TOF) and contrast-enhanced (CE) MRA. We analysed data from studies comparing MRA techniques with DSA for the follow-up of aneurysms undergoing endovascular treatment. Subgroup analysis of stent-assisted coiling (SAC) and flow diversion (FD) techniques was completed. METHODS: Comprehensive searches using the Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were performed and updated to November 2018. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated using aneurysm occlusion status as defined by the Raymond-Roy occlusion grading scale. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 1579 unique titles. Forty-three studies were included. For TOF-MRA, sensitivity and specificity of all aneurysms undergoing endovascular therapy were 88\% and 94\%, respectively. For CE-MRA, the sensitivity and specificity were 88\% and 96\%, respectively. For SAC and FD techniques, sensitivity and specificity of TOF-MRA were 86\% and 95\%, respectively. CE-MRA had sensitivity and specificity of 90\% and 92\%. CONCLUSION: MRA is a reliable modality for the follow-up of aneurysms treated using endovascular techniques. While the data are limited, MRA techniques can also be used to reliably follow patients undergoing FD and SAC. However, clinical factors must be used to optimize follow-up regimens for individual patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The recently introduced Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology (Pipeline Shield) is the third generation of Pipeline flow-diverter devices. It has a new stent-surface modification, which reduces thrombogenicity. We aimed to evaluate clinical and radiographic (safety and efficacy) outcomes of the Pipeline Shield. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 30-day and 1-year mortality and morbidity rates and the 6- and 18-month radiographic aneurysm occlusion outcomes for procedures performed between March 2016 and January 2018 were analyzed. 3D-TOF-MRA was used for follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-four attempted Pipeline Shield procedures were performed for 41 patients with 44 target aneurysms (total of 52 aneurysms treated). A total of 88.5\% of devices were inserted in the anterior circulation, and 11.5\%, in the posterior circulation; 49/52 (94.2\%) aneurysms were saccular; and 1/52 (1.9\%) was fusiform. One (1.9\%) aneurysm was an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm, and 1 (1.9\%) was a dissecting aneurysm. Seventy-one percent (35/49) of the saccular aneurysms were wide-neck (neck, {$>$}4\,mm), 34.6\% (18/52) were large ({$\geq$}10\,mm), and 3.8\% (2/52) were giant ({$\geq$}25\,mm). The mean aneurysm sac maximal diameter was 9.0\,mm, and the mean neck width was 5.0\,mm. The cumulative mortality and morbidity rates were 2.3\% and 6.8\% at 1\,year, respectively. The adequate occlusion rate was 78.8\% at 6\,months and 90.3\% at 18\,months. CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic and non-industry-sponsored study, the occlusion rates and safety outcomes were similar to those seen in previously published studies with flow-diverter devices and earlier generation Pipeline Embolization Devices.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Pipeline Vantage Embolization Device (PEDV) is the fourth-generation pipeline flow diverter for intracranial aneurysm treatment. There are no outcome studies for the second PEDV version. We aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes. Primary and secondary objectives were to determine outcomes for unruptured and ruptured cohorts, respectively. METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective and prospective study, we analyzed outcome data from eight centers using core laboratory assessments. We determined 30-day and {$\geq$}3-month mortality and morbidity rates, and 6- and 18-month radiographic aneurysm occlusion rates for procedures performed during the period July 2021-March 2023. RESULTS: We included 121 consecutive patients with 131 aneurysms. The adequate occlusion rate for the unruptured cohort at short-term and medium-term follow up, and also for the ruptured cohort at short-term follow up, was {$>$}90\%. Two aneurysms (1.5\%) underwent retreatment. When mortality attributed to a palliative case in the unruptured cohort, or subarachnoid hemorrhage in the ruptured cohort, was excluded then the overall major adverse event rate in respective cohorts was 7.5\% and 23.5\%, with 0\% mortality rates for each. When all event causes were included on an intention-to-treat basis, the major adverse event rates in respective cohorts were 8.3\% and 40.9\%, with 0.9\% and 22.7\% mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: For unruptured aneurysm treatment, the second PEDV version appears to have a superior efficacy and similar safety profile to previous-generation PEDs. These are acceptable outcomes in this pragmatic and non-industry-sponsored study. Analysis of ruptured aneurysm outcomes is limited by cohort size. Further prospective studies, particularly for ruptured aneurysms, are needed.},

  abstract = {Background: Flow-diverter devices (FDDs) are new-generation stents placed in the parent artery at the level of the aneurysm neck to disrupt the intra-aneurysmal flow thus favoring intra-aneurysmal thrombosis. Objective: The objective of this review article is to define the indication and results of the treatment of intracranial aneurysms by FDD, reviewing 18 studies of endovascular treatment by FDDs for a total of 1704 aneurysms in 1483 patients. Methods: The medical literature on FDDs for intracranial aneurysms was reviewed from 2009 to December 2014. The keywords used were: ``intracranial aneurysms,'' ``brain aneurysms,'' ``flow diverter,'' ``pipeline embolization device,'' ``silk flow diverter,'' ``surpass flow diverter'' and ``FRED flow diverter.'' Results: The use of these stents is advisable mainly for unruptured aneurysms, particularly those located at the internal carotid artery or vertebral and basilar arteries, for fusiform and dissecting aneurysms and for saccular aneurysms with large necks and low dome-to-neck ratio. The rate of aneurysm occlusion progressively increases during follow-up (81.5\% overall rate in this review). The non-negligible rate of ischemic (mean 4.1\%) and hemorrhagic (mean 2.9\%) complications, the neurological morbidity (mean 3.5\%) and the reported mortality (mean 3.4\%) are the main limits of this technique. Conclusion: Treatment with FDDs is a feasible and effective technique for unruptured aneurysms with complex anatomy (fusiform, dissecting, large neck, bifurcation with side branches) where coiling and clipping are difficult or impossible. Patient selection is very important to avoid complications and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. Further studies with longer follow-up are necessary to define the rate of complete occlusion.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow diverters are important tools in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. However, their impact on aneurysmal occlusion rates, morbidity, mortality, and complication rates is not fully examined. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature searching multiple databases for reports on the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with flow-diverter devices. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool outcomes of aneurysmal occlusion rates at 6 months, and procedure-related morbidity, mortality, and complications across studies. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies were included in this analysis, including 1451 patients with 1654 aneurysms. Aneurysmal complete occlusion rate was 76\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 70\%-81\%). Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were 5\% (95\% CI, 4\%-7\%) and 4\% (95\% CI, 3\%-6\%), respectively. The rate of postoperative subarachnoid hemorrhage was 3\% (95\% CI, 2\%-4\%). Intraparenchymal hemorrhage rate was 3\% (95\% CI, 2\%-4\%). Perforator infarction rate was 3\% (95\% CI, 1\%-5\%), with significantly lower odds of perforator infarction among patients with anterior circulation aneurysms compared with those with posterior circulation aneurysms (odds ratio, 0.01; 95\% CI, 0.00-0.08; P{$<$}0.0001). Ischemic stroke rate was 6\% (95\% CI, 4\%-9\%), with significantly lower odds of perforator infarction among patients with anterior circulation aneurysms compared with those with posterior circulation aneurysms (odds ratio, 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.08-0.27; P{$<$}0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that treatment of intracranial aneurysms with flow-diverter devices is feasible and effective with high complete occlusion rates. However, the risk of procedure-related morbidity and mortality is not negligible. Patients with posterior circulation aneurysms are at higher risk of ischemic stroke, particularly perforator infarction. These findings should be considered when considering the best therapeutic option for intracranial aneurysms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Pipeline Vantage Flow diverter (Vantage) is the latest generation of Pipeline flow diverters introducing Cobalt-chronium drawn-filled tubing and 48 to 68 wires. PURPOSE: We report the initial safety and efficacy of Vantage in treating intracranial aneurysms in the published literature. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to established protocols. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web-of-Science, and Embase databases up to December 2023. Original studies reporting treatment outcomes for intracranial aneurysms using Vantage in more than five patients were included. STUDY SELECTION: Pooled data from 5 studies (373 patients, 418 aneurysms) were analyzed. DATA ANALYSIS: Outcomes of interest were: technical success, occlusion rates, complication outcomes and mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS: A technical success rate of 99.2\% (95\% CI: 98.29\%-100\%) was found. In unruptured cases, success rate was 378/383 (99.6\%) versus 17/20 (85.0\%) in ruptured cases (P {$<$} .01). Complete occlusion rate was 74.3\% (95\% CI: 67.43\%-80.59\%), with no significant difference between ruptured and unruptured cases (P = 0.72); median of follow up 6 months. Overall mortality rate was 1.2\% (95\% CI: 0.01\%-3.64\%), significantly higher in ruptured (18.6\%; 95\% CI: 5.13\%-36.26\%) versus unruptured cases (0.23\%; 95\% CI: 0\%-1.36\%) (P {$<$} 0.01). Hemorrhagic complications occurred at 1\% (95\% CI: 0\%-3.36\%) pooled rate. Thromboembolic complications were reported at 6.1\% (95\% CI: 2.60\%-10.73\%), decreasing to 4.35\% (95\% CI: 1.91\%-7.54\%) after excluding one outlier study. LIMITATIONS: Only five studies, some with small number of patients, were included in this meta-analysis which may limit the generalizability of our findings. The absence of long term follow-up also limits the assessment of treatment durability. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we found that Vantage initial experience is similar to previous version of the Pipeline Embolization Device in terms of safety and efficacy for treatment of intracranial aneurysms, in particular unruptured aneurysms. Further prospective and comparative studies with patient outcome data specific to aneurysm location are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of Vantage.},

METHODS: Between August 2020 and March 2022, data from nine Italian neurovascular centres were collected. Data included patients' clinical presentation, aneurysms' size, location and status, technical details, overall complications and mid- to long-term angiographic follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-eight aneurysms in 48 patients were treated using the SVM. Most aneurysms were small ({$\leq$}\,10~mm: no. 29, 60\%) and unruptured (no. 31, 65\%); 13 aneurysms were recurrent after coiling or clipping. 37/48 aneurysms involved the internal carotid artery (77\%). Optimal opening and complete wall apposition of the device were achieved in 46 out of 48 cases (96\%). Four intra- or periprocedural complications occurred (two thrombotic complications successfully resolved, one cerebellar ischemia, one perirenal hematoma), without new neurological deficit. No significant intra-stent stenosis or stent displacement was observed during follow-up. No FD-related morbidity nor mortality was reported. At midterm (6-12~months) to long-term ({$>$}\,12~months) follow-up, complete aneurysm occlusion (OKM D) was achieved in 76\% of cases. Eighty-eight percent of patients had complete aneurysm occlusion or entry remnant (OKM D\,+\,C). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that the new generation of low-profile SVM flow diverter for the treatment of proximal intracranial aneurysms is safe and effective, with low rates of intraprocedural complications and acceptable mid- to long-term occlusion rate.},

The Pipeline Vantage Flow Diverter (PVFD) with Shield Technology is the new fourth generation of this implant, with modifications made compared to previous iterations. We aimed to evaluate the mechanical properties and clinical safety and efficacy of this device. METHODS: Vanguard is a single arm, single center, prospective study. Between April 2021 and April 2023, all consecutive patients with an unruptured aneurysm treated with Pipeline Vantage flow-diverting stents were included. There were no aneurysm size or location exclusion criteria. Safety (neurological serious adverse events) and efficacy (device deployment and aneurysm occlusion) were independently reviewed. Imaging follow-up data, and immediate, early ({$<$}30\,days), and delayed ({$>$}30\,days) neurological serious adverse events were independently assessed. RESULTS: 101 consecutive patients with a total of 115 aneurysms were included. The aneurysms were situated in the anterior (90.4\%) or posterior (9.6\%) circulations. A total of 124 devices were implanted. The deployment success rate was 100\%. In four (4.0\%) cases post-deployment angioplasty was required to optimize device wall apposition. Occlusion rates at 1\,month were 54.7\%, at 3\,months 72.1\%, and at 6 months 81.7\%. Morbidity and mortality were 4.9\% and 0\%, respectively, at 6\,months. Eight cases (6.9\%) demonstrated in-stent stenosis, four of which had 'fish mouth' deformity. CONCLUSION: Initial results of the new generation PVFD for unruptured intracranial aneurysm treatment demonstrate overall satisfactory device performance, safety profile, and effectiveness.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The Pipeline Vantage flow diverter with Shield technology (PV) used in this study is a 4th-generation flow diverter (FD) designed to reduce thrombogenicity, promote endothelialization of the implant and increase efficiency in achieving aneurysm closure. In this study, we report the aneurysm occlusion rate, complication rate and clinical outcome with short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in the treatment of unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms using the PV. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients treated between September 2021 and January 2023 with the PV and subsequently underwent short-term DAPT for 3 months. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, peri- and post-procedural complications, clinical outcomes and the grade of aneurysm occlusion were documented. RESULTS: Thirty patients with 32 aneurysms were treated. Successful FD implantation was achieved in all cases (100\%). No periprocedural complications were documented. The overall symptomatic complication rate was 10\% and the neurologic, treatment-related symptomatic complication rate was 6.6\%. Only one symptomatic complication (3.3\%) was device-related. Permanent clinical deterioration occurred in 2/30 patients (6.6\%), leading to deterioration of the mRS within the first 3 months after treatment. No mortality was documented. The rate of complete aneurysm occlusion after 3 months and after a mean imaging follow-up of 9.9 months was 65.6\% and 75\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Implantation of the PV for the treatment of saccular intracranial aneurysms achieves a good aneurysm occlusion rate with a low rate of complications. In addition, the use of short-term DAPT after PV implantation appears to be safe.},

  abstract = {Flow diverters have become a critical instrument for complex aneurysms treatment. However, limited data are currently available regarding short and long-term outcomes for the Silk flow diverter. The objective of the study is to determine neurological prognosis and mortality rates for the Silk flow diversion device used in intracranial aneurysms. A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed using databases. The following descriptors were used for the search: "SILK", "Flow Diverter", "Mortality", and "Prognosis". The following data were extracted: mortality, good functional outcome, Glasgow outcome scale, complete or near-complete occlusion rates, rate of retreatment, and complications (thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications). A total of 14 studies were selected. Among the 14 studies, 13 were retrospective observational cohort studies and 1 was a prospective observational cohort study. The mortality rate was 2.84\%. The clinical good outcomes rate was 93.3\%. The poor outcome rate was 6.6\%. The overall thromboembolic complication rate was 6.06\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-6.37, P=0.12, I2=3.13\%). The total hemorrhagic complication rate was 1.62\% (95\% CI 0.00-5.34, P=0.28, I2=1.56\%). The complete aneurysm occlusion rate was 80.4\% (95\% CI 8.65-9.38, P{$<$}0.0001, I2=9.09\%). The Silk diverter device has a good safety and efficacy profile for treating intracranial aneurysms with high complete occlusion rates.},

Treatments are associated with thrombogenic events mandating the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in all cases. In the current in vitro study, we utilize a slow binding fluorogenic thrombin specific substrate to measure the thrombin generation potential of six devices: four FD devices (Pipeline™ Flex embolization device, Pipeline™ Flex embolization device with Shield Technology™, SILK+, FRED™) and two AB devices (Solitaire™ AB, LEO+). We show that the Pipeline™ Flex embolization device with Shield Technology™ has significantly lower peak thrombin and takes significantly longer time to achieve peak thrombin (time to peak) compared to the other three FD devices (p~{$<~$}0.05), with statistically similar results to the less thrombogenic AB devices. We conclude that surface modification of endoluminal stents could be an effective method to mitigate thrombogenic complications.},

Recently, a novel biomimetic surface modification with covalently bound phosphorylcholine (Shield Technology™) has shown to reduce the material thrombogenicity of the Pipeline flow diverter. Thrombogenicity of Pipeline Flex, Pipeline Shield, and Flow Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED) in the presence of human blood under physiological flow conditions-in addition to relative increase in thrombogenicity with multiple devices-remains unknown and was investigated here. Thrombin generation (mean {\textpm} SD; {$\mu$}g/mL; thrombin-antithrombin complex or TAT) was measured as FRED (30.3 {\textpm} 2.9), Pipeline (13.9 {\textpm} 4.4), Pipeline Shield (0.4 {\textpm} 0.3), and negative control (no device; 0.1 {\textpm} 0.0). Platelet activation (mean {\textpm} SD; IU/{$\mu$}L; beta-thromboglobulin or {$\beta$}TG) was measured as FRED (148 {\textpm} 45), Pipeline (92.8 {\textpm} 41), Pipeline Shield (16.2 {\textpm} 3.5), and negative control (2.70 {\textpm} 0.16). FRED was significantly more thrombogenic than Pipeline and Pipeline Shield (p {$<$} 0.05) for TAT. Additionally, Pipeline Shield had significantly lower TAT and {$\beta$}TG than the other devices tested (p {$<$} 0.05) and these were comparable to the negative control (p {$>$} 0.05). TAT and {$\beta$}TG scaled proportionately with multiple Pipeline devices (N = 6) but was unaffected by multiple Pipeline Shield (N = 6) devices-the latter being statistically similar to negative control (p {$>$} 0.05). {\copyright} 2018 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the procedural feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this device. METHODS: The Pipe-VADER study was designed as a retrospective, observational study of consecutive patients treated with the Vantage at 3 neurovascular centers. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural parameters, early complications, and extent of postinterventional contrast retention were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with 31 aneurysms (median size: 5.0~mm, posterior circulation: 4 [12.9\%], ruptured: 5 [16.1\%]) were included. The technical success rate was 100\%, with multiple stents used in 4/30 (13.3\%) procedures. Of the 30 procedures, adjunctive coiling was performed in 3 (10.0\%) and balloon angioplasty in 2 (6.7\%). Median procedure time was 62~minutes. Procedural ischemic stroke occured in 4 (13.3\%) cases, whereof 2 were major strokes (6.6\%). There were no hemorrhagic complications. Initial contrast retention was observed in 29/31 (93.5\%) aneurysms. All 27 overstented side vessels~were patent at the end of the procedure. Short-term follow-up (median: 5 months) showed complete and favorable occlusion rates of 70\% (14/20) and 80\% (16/20), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The new Pipeline Vantage appears to be safe and feasible for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms and warrants further evaluation.},

The newer Pipeline generations have received structural refinements and a surface modification to improve deliverability, procedural safety, and angiographic outcomes. This multicenter study evaluated the clinical safety and efficacy of the 2 surface-modified Pipeline iterations, Pipeline Vantage and Pipeline Flex with Shield Technology (PFS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients treated between 2017 and 2023 were retrospectively reviewed for aneurysm characteristics, procedural details, complications, and angiographic outcomes. The safety end point was the rate of procedural and postprocedural major neurologic events occurring during the hospital stay. The efficacy end point was the rate of complete occlusion at last follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred forty-one patients underwent 112 Pipeline Vantage procedures and 32 PFS procedures for 147 aneurysms with a mean size of 8.0 (SD, 5.9) mm (11\% ruptured, 16\% posterior circulation, 18\% nonsaccular morphology). All procedures were technically successful with a mean of 1.2 devices implanted. Balloon angioplasty was required in 20/144 (13.9\%) procedures. Major neurologic adverse events occurred in 6/144 (4.2\%) procedures (all ischemic stroke), resulting in death in 2 (1.4\%) patients. There were no hemorrhagic complications. At a mean of 11\,months, complete occlusion was achieved in 85/112 (75.9\%) aneurysms, 15/112 (13.4\%) had an entry remnant, and 12/112 (10.7\%) had an aneurysm remnant. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate high feasibility, procedural safety, and efficacy of the surface-modified Pipeline flow diverters.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Pipeline Vantage Embolization Device (PVED) is a novel coated flow diverter with reduced wire diameters to improve neoendothelialization and stent porosity. This systematic review evaluates the safety and efficacy of the PVED based on the current literature. METHODS: Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a thorough literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane. The random effects model was used to calculate estimates with major neurological complications within 30 days of treatment as the primary safety endpoint and {$\leq$}1-year complete occlusion rate as the primary efficacy endpoint. RESULTS: Six single-arm studies (5 retrospective, 1 prospective) with 392 patients and 439 aneurysms (6.8\% ruptured) were included. Antiplatelet regimens varied, but dual antiplatelet therapy was administered in the majority. The pooled technical success rate was 99.0\% (95\%CI, 98.0\%-100\%) with an average of 1.2 devices implanted per procedure. Balloon angioplasty was performed in 17.0\% (95\%CI, 6.4-27.6\%) and adjunctive coiling in 28.0\% (95\%CI, 17.8-38.2\%), with significant heterogeneity for both variables. Pooled estimates for major neurological complications were 3.5\% (95\%CI, 1.7\%-5.2\%) with total ischemic events in 4.1\% (95\% CI, 1.6\%-6.6\%) and hemorrhagic events in 1.0\% (95\% CI, 0.0\%-1.9\%). The rate of complete angiographic occlusion was 75.7\% (95\%CI, 70.7\%-80.6\%) at a mean follow-up of 7 months, with in-stent stenoses in 8.1\% (95\%CI, 4.5\%-11.8\%). CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy profile of the PVED appears comparable to competing devices, with potentially fewer complications than first-generation flow diverters. Long-term and comparative studies are needed to further confirm these results.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PED for treatment of wide necked small and medium intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: PREMIER is a prospective, multicenter, single arm trial. Patients were treated with the PED for unruptured wide necked aneurysms, measuring {$\leq$}12\,mm along the internal carotid artery or vertebral artery, between July 2014 and November 2015. At 1\,year post-procedure, the primary effectiveness endpoint was complete occlusion (Raymond grade 1) without major parent vessel stenosis ({$\leq$}50\%) or retreatment, and the primary safety endpoint was major stroke in the territory supplied by the treated artery or neurologic death. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients were treated with PEDs (mean age 54.6{\textpm}11.3 years, 87.9\% (124/141) women). Mean aneurysm size was 5.0{\textpm}1.92\,mm, and 84.4\% (119/141) measured {$<$}7\,mm. PED placement was successful in 99.3\% (140/141) of patients. Mean number of PEDs implanted per patient was 1.1{\textpm}0.26; a single PED was used in 92.9\% (131/141) of patients. At 1\,year, 97.9\% (138/141) of patients underwent follow-up angiography with 76.8\% (106/138) of patients having met the study's primary effectiveness endpoint. The combined major morbidity and mortality rate was 2.1\% (3/140). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of wide necked small/medium aneurysms with the PED results in high rates of complete occlusion without significant parent vessel stenosis and low rates of permanent neurologic complications.

The Aneurysm Study of Pipeline In an observational Registry (ASPIRe) study prospectively analyzed rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and neurologic adverse events following PED treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter study prospectively evaluating patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with PED. Primary outcomes included (1) spontaneous rupture of the Pipeline-treated aneurysm; (2) spontaneous nonaneurysmal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH); (3) acute ischemic stroke; (4) parent artery stenosis, and (5) permanent cranial neuropathy. Secondary endpoints were (1) treatment success and (2) morbidity and mortality at the 6-month follow-up. Vascular imaging was evaluated at an independent core laboratory. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one patients with 207 treated aneurysms were included in this registry. The mean aneurysm size was 14.5 {\textpm} 6.9 mm, and the median imaging follow-up was 7.8 months. Twenty-four aneurysms (11.6\%) were small, 162 (78.3\%) were large and 21 (10.1\%) were giant. The median clinical follow-up time was 6.2 months. The neurological morbidity rate was 6.8\% (13/191), and the neurological mortality rate was 1.6\% (3/191). The combined neurological morbidity/mortality rate was 6.8\% (13/191). The most common adverse events were ischemic stroke (4.7\%, 9/191) and spontaneous ICH (3.7\%, 7/191). The complete occlusion rate at the last follow-up was 74.8\% (77/103). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective postmarket study confirms that PED treatment of aneurysms in a heterogeneous patient population is safe with low rates of neurological morbidity and mortality. Patients with angiographic follow-up had complete occlusion rates of 75\% at 8 months.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow diverters are increasingly used in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Our aim was to determine neurologic complication rates following Pipeline Embolization Device placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment in a real-world setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device between July 2008 and February 2013 in 17 centers worldwide. We defined 4 subgroups: internal carotid artery aneurysms of Ն10 mm, ICA aneurysms of Ͻ10 mm, other anterior circulation aneurysms, and posterior circulation aneurysms. Neurologic complications included spontaneous rupture, intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, permanent cranial neuropathy, and mortality. Comparisons were made with t tests or ANOVAs for continuous variables and the Pearson ␹2 or Fisher exact test for categoric variables. RESULTS: In total, 793 patients with 906 aneurysms were included. The neurologic morbidity and mortality rate was 8.4\% (67/793), highest in the posterior circulation group (16.4\%, 9/55) and lowest in the ICA Ͻ10-mm group (4.8\%, 14/294) (P ϭ .01). The spontaneous rupture rate was 0.6\% (5/793). The intracranial hemorrhage rate was 2.4\% (19/793). Ischemic stroke rates were 4.7\% (37/793), highest in patients with posterior circulation aneurysms (7.3\%, 4/55) and lowest in the ICA Ͻ10-mm group (2.7\%, 8/294) (P ϭ .16). Neurologic mortality was 3.8\% (30/793), highest in the posterior circulation group (10.9\%, 6/55) and lowest in the anterior circulation ICA Ͻ10-mm group (1.4\%, 4/294) (P Ͻ .01). CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysm treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device is associated with the lowest complication rates when used to treat small ICA aneurysms. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality are higher in the treatment of posterior circulation and giant aneurysms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The authors performed a pooled analysis of 3 studies-IntrePED (International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device), PUFS (Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms Study), and ASPIRe (Aneurysm Study of Pipeline in an Observational Registry)-in order to assess angiographic outcomes and clinical safety of the Pipeline embolization device (PED). METHODS IntrePED was a retrospective study, while PUFS and ASPIRe were prospective studies. For each patient included in these studies, the authors collected baseline demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, and procedural details. The primary outcomes for this combined analysis were clinical outcomes, including neurological morbidity and mortality and major ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The secondary outcomes were angiographic occlusion rates, which were available for ASPIRe and PUFS only. RESULTS A total of 1092 patients with 1221 aneurysms were included across the 3 studies. The mean aneurysm size was 12.0 {\textpm} 7.8 mm and the mean neck size was 6.6 {\textpm} 4.8 mm. The major ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate was 3.7\% (40/1091). The major ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage rate was 2.0\% (22/1091). The major neurological morbidity rate was 5.7\% (62/1091). The neurological mortality rate was 3.3\% (36/1091). The combined major morbidity and neurological mortality rate was 7.1\% (78/1091). The complete occlusion rates were 75.0\% at 180 days (111/148) and 85.5\% at 1 year (94/110). The overall aneurysm retreatment rate was 3.0\% (33/1091) at a mean follow-up time of 10.2 {\textpm} 10.8 months. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the PED is safe and effective. Angiographic occlusion rates progressed with follow-up. Rates of stroke, hemorrhage, morbidity and mortality, and retreatment were low, especially given the fact that the aneurysms treated were generally large and wide necked.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term outcomes from the Pipeline Embolization Devices for the Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms (PEDESTRIAN) Registry. METHODS: The PEDESTRIAN Registry data were retrospectively reviewed, which included patients (March 2006 to July 2019) with complex IAs treated with PED. Patients with unfavorable anatomy and/or recurrence following previous treatment were included and excluded those with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. The primary angiographic endpoint was complete occlusion and long-term stability. Clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at 3 to 6 mo, 12 mo, and yearly thereafter. RESULTS: A total of 835 patients (mean age 55.9~{\textpm}~14.7 yr; 80.0\% female) with 1000 aneurysms were included. Aneurysms varied in size: 64.6\% were small ({$\leq$}10~mm), 25.6\% were large (11-24~mm), and 9.8\% were giant ({$\geq$}25~mm). A total of 1214 PEDs were deployed. Follow-up angiography was available for 85.1\% of patients with 776 aneurysms at 24.6~{\textpm} 25.0 mo (mean). Complete occlusion was demonstrated in 75.8\% of aneurysms at 12 mo, 92.9\% at 2 to 4 yr, and 96.4\% at {$>$}5~yr. During the postprocedural period, modified Rankin Scale scores remained stable or improved in 96.2\% of patients, with stability or improvement in 99.1\% of patients {$>$}5~yr. The overall major morbidity and neurological mortality rate was 5.8\%. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated high rates of long-term complete aneurysm occlusion, stable or improved functional outcomes, and low rates of complications and mortality. Clinical and angiographic outcomes improved over long-term follow-up, demonstrating that endovascular treatment of IA with PED is safe and effective.},

The Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology (Pipeline Shield) is an updated version of the PED which has been modified to include a surface phosphorylcholine biocompatible polymer. Its early technical success and safety have been reported previously. Here, we assessed the long-term safety and efficacy of the Pipeline Shield for the treatment of IAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology (PFLEX) study was a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study for the treatment of unruptured IAs using the Pipeline Shield. The primary endpoint was a major stroke in the territory supplied by the treated artery or neurologic death at 1-year post-procedure. Angiographic outcomes were also assessed by an independent radiology laboratory at 6\,months and 1\,year. RESULTS: Fifty patients (mean age, 53 years; 82\% female) with 50 unruptured IAs were treated. Mean aneurysm diameter was 8.82{\textpm}6.15\,mm. Of the target aneurysms, 38/50 (76\%) were small ({$<$}10\,mm), 11/50 (22\%) were large ({$\geq$}10\,and{$<$}25\,mm), and 1/50 (2\%) was giant ({$\geq$}25\,mm). Forty-seven (94\%) were located in the internal carotid artery and three (6\%) in the vertebral artery. At 1-year post-procedure, no major strokes or neurologic deaths were reported, and complete occlusion was achieved in 27/33 (81.8\%). There were no instances of aneurysm recurrence or retreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our 1-year follow-up concerning angiographic and safety outcomes corroborate previous evidence that the Pipeline Shield is a safe and effective treatment for IAs.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) is the standard for evaluating coiled aneurysms (Class I: complete obliteration; Class II: residual neck; Class III: residual aneurysm), but not all Class III aneurysms behave the same over time. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 370 patients with 390 intracranial aneurysms treated with coil embolization. A Modified Raymond-Roy Classification (MRRC), in which Class IIIa designates contrast within the coil interstices and Class IIIb contrast along the aneurysm wall, was applied retrospectively. RESULTS: Class IIIa aneurysms were more likely to improve to Class I or II than Class IIIb aneurysms (83.34\% vs 14.89\%, p{$<$}0.001) and were also more likely than Class II to improve to Class I (52.78\% vs 16.90\%, p{$<$}0.001). Class IIIb aneurysms were more likely to remain incompletely occluded than Class IIIa aneurysms (85.11\% vs 16.67\%, p{$<$}0.001). Class IIIb aneurysms were larger with wider necks while Class IIIa aneurysms had higher packing density. Class IIIb aneurysms had a higher retreatment rate (33.87\% vs 6.54\%, p{$<$}0.001) and a trend toward higher subsequent rupture rate (3.23\% vs 0.00\%, p=0.068). CONCLUSIONS: We propose the MRRC to further differentiate Class III aneurysms into those likely to progress to complete occlusion and those likely to remain incompletely occluded or to worsen. The MRRC has the potential to expand the definition of adequate coil embolization, possibly decrease procedural risk, and help endovascular neurosurgeons predict which patients need closer angiographic follow-up. These findings need to be validated in a prospective study with independent blinded angiographic grading.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flow diverters (FDs) have become an integral part of treatment for brain aneurysms. AIM: To summarize available evidence of factors associated with aneurysm occlusion (AO) after treatment with a FD. METHODS: References were identified using the Nested Knowledge AutoLit semi-automated review platform between January 1, 2008 and August 26, 2022. The review focuses on preprocedural and postprocedural factors associated with AO identified in logistic regression analysis. Studies were included if they met the inclusion criteria of study details (ie, study design, sample size, location, (pre)treatment aneurysm details). Evidence levels were classified by variability and significancy across studies (eg, low variability {$\geq$}5 studies and significance in {$\geq$}60\% throughout reports). RESULTS: Overall, 2.03\% (95\% CI 1.22 to 2.82; 24/1184) of screened studies met the inclusion criteria for predictors of AO based on logistic regression analysis. Predictors of AO with low variability in multivariable logistic regression analysis included aneurysm characteristics (aneurysm diameter), particularly complexity (absence of branch involvement) and younger patient age. Predictors of moderate evidence for AO included aneurysm characteristics (neck width), patient characteristics (absence of hypertension), procedural (adjunctive coiling) and post-deployment variables (longer follow-up; direct postprocedural satisfactory occlusion). Variables with a high variability in predicting AO following FD treatment were gender, FD as re-treatment strategy, and aneurysm morphology (eg, fusiform or blister). CONCLUSION: Evidence of predictors for AO after FD treatment is sparse. Current literature suggests that absence of branch involvement, younger age, and aneurysm diameter have the highest impact on AO following FD treatment. Large studies investigating high-quality data with well-defined inclusion criteria are needed for greater insight into FD effectiveness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endoluminal reconstruction with flow diverting devices represents a novel constructive technique for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. We present the results of the first prospective multicenter trial of a flow-diverting construct for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with unruptured aneurysms that were wide-necked ({$>$} 4 mm), had unfavorable dome/neck ratios ({$<$}1.5), or had failed previous therapy were enrolled in the PITA trial between January and May 2007 at 4 (3 European and 1 South American) centers. Aneurysms were treated with the PED with or without adjunctive coil embolization. All patients underwent clinical evaluation at 30 and 180 days and conventional angiography 180 days after treatment. Angiographic results were adjudicated by an experienced neuroradiologist at a nonparticipating site. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with 31 intracranial aneurysms (6 men; 42-76 years of age; average age, 54.6 years) were treated during the study period. Twenty-eight aneurysms arose from the ICA (5 cavernous, 15 parophthalmic, 4 superior hypophyseal, and 4 posterior communicating segments), 1 from the MCA, 1 from the vertebral artery, and 1 from the vertebrobasilar junction. Mean aneurysm size was 11.5 mm, and mean neck size was 5.8 mm. Twelve (38.7\%) aneurysms had failed (or recurred after) a previous endovascular treatment. PED placement was technically successful in 30 of 31 patients (96.8\%). Most aneurysms were treated with either 1 (n = 18) or 2 (n = 11) PEDs. Fifteen aneurysms (48.4\%) were treated with a PED alone, while 16 were treated with both PED and embolization coils. Two patients experienced major periprocedural stroke. Follow-up angiography demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion in 28 (93.3\%) of the 30 patients who underwent angiographic follow-up. No significant in-construct stenosis ({$\geq$} 50\%) was identified at follow-up angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial aneurysm treatment with the PED is technically feasible and can be achieved with a safety profile analogous to that reported for stent-supported coil embolization. PED treatment elicited a very high rate (93\%) of complete angiographic occlusion at 6 months in a population of the most challenging anatomic subtypes of cerebral aneurysms.},

Of the various flow diverter models, the Pipeline device has been the main approved and used device, with established and good long-term results. OBJECTIVE: To present the first series of patients treated with its new version, the Pipeline Flex device. This has kept the same device design and configuration but redesigned and completely modified the delivery system. METHODS: In this technical report, we include 10 consecutive patients harboring 12 saccular aneurysms of the anterior circulation. We report the main changes on the system, immediate results, and technical nuances with illustrative cases. RESULTS: We implanted 12 devices, including 11 Pipeline Flex and one Pipeline device. We used the old version in one case that required a second layer with a short length not available in the Pipeline Flex size range. All attempts at treatment were successful and no device was discharged or removed. Recovery was required or used in half of the cases with good or excellent performance, except in one case that presented with multiple proximal loops and tight curves. We had two transitory events without ischemic lesions on MRI that recovered 1 and 4\>h after all patients were discharged home asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Pipeline Flex represents a major advance in FDS technology. The redesigned system has significantly improved the deployment of the Pipeline stent, by enabling the operator to resheath the device. It has the potential to continue revolutionizing the endovascular approach for intracranial aneurysms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Acute ischemic stroke and silent cerebral infarctions following pipeline embolization device (PED) treatment of intracranial aneurysms have been estimated to occur in 3-6\%\,and in 50.9-90\% of patients respectively. The PED with Shield technology (PED-Shield) incorporates a surface phosphorylcholine polymer to reduce the thrombogenicity of the implant. We sought to determine the incidence of diffusion weighted image (DWI) documented cerebral ischemia after PED-Shield treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: This prospective study involved a single center series of consecutive patients treated for an unruptured intracranial aneurysm with the PED-Shield. All participants underwent clinical evaluation on admission, after the procedure, at discharge, and 30 days following treatment. Brain MRI was obtained within 72\,hours of the procedure. Ischemic lesions identified on DWI sequences where examined as to their number, size, and location in relation to the procedure. RESULTS: Over 12 months, 33 patients harboring 38 intracranial aneurysms were treated with the PED-Shield in 36 procedures. Neither mortality nor clinically evident ischemic events were noted in the 30\,day postprocedural period. DWI documented, silent cerebral ischemia occurred in six patients (18.18\%) after six procedures (16.66\%). No statistically significant risk factors for postprocedural silent cerebral ischemia were identified. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a reduced rate of silent cerebral infarcts following PED-Shield treatment of intracranial aneurysms than previously reported with other endovascular treatment modalities and with the previous device generations. Further research is necessary to evaluate our results and to identify methods to reduce the incidence of postprocedural cerebral ischemic events.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Surpass Evolve (SE) has emerged as a promising alternative treatment from the flow diverter series. The utilization of the SE has gradually increased, however, there is a scarcity of comprehensive data on the solidity of this technology in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the SE flow diverter. METHODS: A systematic literature search from inception to April 2024 was conducted across five databases for studies involving IAs treated with the SE. The primary effectiveness outcome was the proportion of complete aneurysm occlusion at the final follow-up, and the primary safety outcome comprised a composite of early and delayed complications. Subgroup analyses based on aneurysm size, anatomical location, and rupture status were also conducted. RESULTS: Our analysis included nine studies with 645 patients and 722 IAs. Effectiveness outcomes revealed an overall complete aneurysm occlusion rate of 69\% (95\% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,58\%-78\%; I2\,=\,72\%) and a favorable aneurysm occlusion rate of 91\% (95\% CI\,=\,82\%-96\%; I2\,=\,49\%). Safety outcomes demonstrated an overall complications rate of 6\% (95\% CI\,=\,3\%-12\%; I2\,=\,66\%), with an early complications rate of 6\% (95\% CI\,=\,4\%-11\%; I2\,=\,0\%), and a delayed complications rate of 0\% (95\% CI\,=\,0\%-7\%; I2\,=\,0\%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a favorable outcome with a high rate of complete aneurysm occlusion at the last follow-up, with acceptable rates of neurological complications. Future research efforts should focus on larger, prospective studies with standardized outcome measures to further elucidate the clinical utility of the SE flow diverter in the management of IAs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device X (FRED X) is a newer generation flow diverter with surface modifications aimed at minimizing thrombogenicity. At present, data on its long-term efficacy are limited. This multicenter study presents the largest series within the United States describing the device's efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes in treating cerebral aneurysms of varying morphology. METHODS: Patients treated with the FRED X for a cerebral aneurysm between February 2022 and February 2024 at 6 high-volume centers across the United States were included. Data were collected regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and procedural efficacy. Angiographic and clinical follow-up outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 154 patients with 162 aneurysms were treated with 164 FRED X devices over the study period. Overall, 81.8\% of the cohort was female with a mean age of 56.8 years. The authors observed satisfactory rates ({$\geq$} 99.3\%) of device deployment and good wall apposition and neck coverage. One hundred forty-seven (95.5\%) patients were functionally independent at discharge (modified Rankin Scale scores 0-2). Rates of adequate occlusion (Raymond-Roy Occlusion Scale score I or II) increased from 84.2\% at 6 months to 83.5\% at the 12-month follow-up, while rates of in-stent stenosis decreased. All patients (100\%) who underwent follow-up were functionally independent at 6 months, and 95.9\% were functionally independent at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter cohort study demonstrates the ease of FRED X deployment with an adequate safety profile, with low rates of procedural complications and favorable outcomes on follow-up. Rates of aneurysm occlusion increased over time, with a subsequent decrease in stent-associated complications.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The recently introduced Pipeline Vantage Embolization Device with Shield Technology is the fourth generation of Pipeline flow diverter devices. Due to the relatively high rate of intraprocedural technical complications, modifications were subsequently made to the device after a~limited release of the device in 2020. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the modified version of this device. METHODS: This was a~multicentre retrospective series. The primary efficacy endpoint was aneurysm occlusion in the absence of retreatment. The primary safety endpoint was any neurological morbidity or death. Ruptured and unruptured aneurysms were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 52~procedures were performed for 60~target aneurysms. Treatment was performed on 5~patients with ruptured aneurysms. The technical success rate was 98\%. The mean clinical follow-up time was 5.5~months. In patients presenting with unruptured aneurysms there were no deaths, 3 (6.4\%) major complications and 7 (13\%) minor complications. In the five patients presenting with subarachnoid haemorrhage there were 2 (40\%) major complications with 1 (20\%) of these resulting in death, and 1 (20\%) minor complication. Of the patients 29~(56\%) had undergone 6-monthly postprocedural angiographic imaging with a~mean time of 6.6~months demonstrating that 83\% of patients had achieved adequate occlusion (RROC1/2) of the aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: In this non-industry-sponsored study, the occlusion rates and safety outcomes were similar to those seen in previously published studies with flow diverter devices and earlier generation Pipeline devices. Modifications to the device appear to have improved ease of deployment.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} The Pipeline Vantage Embolization Device with Shield Technology is a next generation flow diverter developed to improve aneurysm occlusion and implant endothelialization in addition to lowering thrombogenicity. We report here the in vivo biocompatibility and in vitro hemocompatibility performance of the Pipeline Vantage Embolization Device with Shield Technology (Vantage) compared with the Pipeline Flex Embolization Device (Flex). Methods{\enspace} Biocompatibility (via histology), aneurysm occlusion and vessel patency (via angiography), and endothelial coverage (via scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) for the Vantage and Flex devices were assessed in the rabbit elastase aneurysm model at 90 days (n=29) and 180 days (n=27). In vitro thrombogenicity for Flex and Vantage (n=16) was assessed using a human blood flow loop model at low heparin concentration (0.6\,U/ mL) with thrombin generation, platelet activation and thrombus visualization as outputs. Results{\enspace} Raymond Roy Occlusion Classification grade 1 was higher for Vantage (61\%) compared with Flex (46\%), but was not statistically significant (p{$>$}0.05). All branch vessels were patent. Histological measures for both devices were similar (p{$>$}0.05). Endothelial coverage of the implant was significantly better for Vantage compared with Flex (p{$<$}0.05). In vitro measurements of thrombin generation (thrombin-\-antithrombin complex ({\textmu}g/mL): Vantage 0.49{\textpm}0.45; Flex 10.57{\textpm}9.84) and platelet activation ({$\beta$}-thromboglobulin (IU/{\textmu}l): Vantage 0.41{\textpm}0.19; Flex 4.14{\textpm}2.38) were both statistically lower (p{$<$}0.05) for Vantage compared with Flex. High resolution microscopy showed less accumulation of thrombus on Vantage as compared with Flex. Conclusion{\enspace} Vantage improved aneurysm occlusion and implant endothelialization and had significantly lower thrombogenicity as compared with Flex, while preserving the biocompatibility safety profile of Flex.},

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of The Pipeline™ Vantage embolization device (Medtronic, Irvine, CA). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study describing the use of The Pipeline™ Vantage embolization device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Technical feasibility and safety were assessed in terms of intra and postprocedural complications, as well as neurological morbidity upon follow-up. Both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms were included. RESULTS: We included 12 patients in our study (mean age 62; females: n\,=\,9/12, 75\%). Aneurysm morphology varied between saccular (41.6\%), fusiform (41.6\%), blister (8.3\%), and pseudoaneurysm (8.3\%). Three cases (25\%) involved ruptured aneurysms treated in the acute setting. A transradial access was used in 10 cases (83.3\%). There was a 100\% success in deployment. Seven cases (58.3\%) were treated with adjunct embolization device other than a flow diversion. Eight cases (66.6\%) were treated with a single flow diversion, three cases (25\%) were treated with two flow diversion, and one case (8.3\%) was treated with three flow diversion stents. There were no intraoperative complications. There was one postprocedural complication in a dissecting ruptured PICA aneurysm that was ultimately treated with two flow diversion stents and an intrasaccular device. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first US series assessing the periprocedural safety and feasibility of consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with the Pipeline™ Vantage device (Medtronic, Irvine, CA).},

This study reports clinical safety and efficacy results of the FRED and FRED Jr FDS in clinical practice in the UK at 6 months and 1 year. METHODS: The FRED-UK study is a single arm, multicentre, prospective, observational study conducted in the UK. Safety was reviewed by evaluating morbidity (modified Rankin Score {$\leq$}2) and mortality. Efficacy was assessed as adequate occlusion of the treated aneurysm. A clinical event committee and core laboratory independently assessed clinical and anatomical results. RESULTS: Seven neurointerventional centers treated 61 patients, 57 of which met the full inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 75.4\% were treated with FRED and 24.6\% with FRED Jr. The aneurysms were located on the cavernous or supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) in 75.4\%, on the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or anterior communicating artery (Acom) in 21.1\%, and on the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 3.5\%. 57.9\% of aneurysms were small ({$<$}10 mm), 40.4\% were large (10-24 mm) and 1.8\% were giant ({$\geq$}25 mm). All-cause morbidity and mortality were 0\% at 6 and 12 months, and adequate occlusion was 86.7\% at 12 months in the per protocol population. CONCLUSIONS: The FRED and FRED Jr devices are safe and efficacious in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of the first generation of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED; Medtronic Inc) have been proven in large case series. Ischemic events are one of the most common complications following treatment of aneurysms with flow diverters. The new PED Flex with Shield technology (PED Shield; Medtronic Inc) was introduced to minimize the rate of complications. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of patients harboring aneurysms treated with the PED Shield. METHODS: This was an observational, prospective, single-arm multicenter study of patients treated with the PED Shield. The primary safety endpoint was the absence of major neurological complications and death. The secondary effectiveness endpoint was angiographic occlusion at 6 and 12 mo. Technical complications were also reported. RESULTS: Between November 2017 and December 2018, 151 patients from 7 centers with 182 aneurysms were enrolled. The mean aneurysm size was 7.0 mm; 27 (14.8\%) aneurysms were large, and 7 (3.8\%) were giant. In 141 of 151 patients (93.4\%), the primary endpoint was reached. The overall rate of periprocedural complications was 7.3\%. Of the aneurysms, 79.7\% met the study's secondary endpoint of complete occlusion at 6 mo and 85.3\% at 12 mo. CONCLUSION: The PED Shield is a safe and effective treatment for intracranial aneurysms. The results regarding total occlusion and ischemic complications did not differ from those obtained in case series using previous versions of the PED. Long-term follow-up and comparative studies are required to provide stronger conclusions regarding the reduced thrombogenicity of this device.},

New flow diverters (FDs) are being introduced to improve the safety and efficacy of this treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of the new Pipeline Vantage (PV) FD. METHODS: Patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with the PV at 10 international neurovascular centers were retrospectively analyzed. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural parameters, complications, and the grade of occlusion were assessed. RESULTS: 60 patients with 70 aneurysms (5.0\% with acute hemorrhage, 90.0\% located in the anterior circulation) were included. 82 PVs were implanted in 61 treatment sessions. The PV could be successfully implanted in all treatments. Additional coiling was performed in 18.6\%, and in-stent balloon angioplasty (to enhance the vessel wall apposition) in 24.6\%. Periprocedural technical complications occurred in 24.6\% of the treatments, were predominantly FD deployment problems, and were all asymptomatic. The overall symptomatic complication rate was 8.2\% and the neurological symptomatic complication rate was 3.3\%. Only one symptomatic complication was device-related (perforator artery infarctions leading to stroke). After a mean follow-up of 7.1 months, the rate of complete aneurysm occlusion was 77.9\%. One patient (1.7\%) died due to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage which occurred before treatment, unrelated to the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The new PV FD is safe and feasible for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The short-term occlusion rates are promising but need further assessment in prospective long-term follow-up studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The introduction of flow-diverting stents in the last decade provides an alternative endovascular treatment choice in selected intracranial aneurysms. This retrospective analysis of a UK centre's experience provides insight into clinical and radiographic outcomes. METHODS: Electronic patient records, diagnostic and procedural images and written procedural records for patients treated with the PED between August 2009 and April 2014 were reviewed. Follow-up TOF MRA was performed after treatment. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were analyzed and compared with other PED studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with 30 attempted PED treatments were reviewed representing 3.5\% of the treated aneurysm patient cohort. 63.6\% (21/33) of the aneurysms were wide-necked ({$>$}4\,mm), 60.6\% (20/33) were large or giant ({$\geq$}10\,mm). The mean aneurysm sac diameter was 12.0\,mm; the mean neck width was 4.5\,mm. Mortality and morbidity rates were 3.3\% and 10.0\%, respectively. The total adequate occlusion rate was 78.1\% (25/32) at 18 months. The neck width of aneurysms with residual sac filling and complete occlusion differed significantly (p\,=\,0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Highly selected aneurysms treated with a PED in a UK centre have similar occlusion and complication rates when compared to non-UK studies. Again, it appeared that delayed aneurysm rupture remained a risk for PED treatment in large or giant aneurysms. Follow-up with TOF MRA gave similar occlusion results compared to those obtained with DSA in other studies. The influence of neck size on occlusion rate should be examined in future PED studies.},

This study summarises periprocedural outcomes and 6-month follow-up results following its introduction in a tertiary interventional neuroradiology centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-arm study assessed 32 aneurysms treated over a 21-month time period from the time of procedure to 6 months post-procedure. Data collected included patient demographics, aneurysm features and intraprocedural and 6-month post-procedural complications. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 58.8\,{\textpm}\,Standard Deviation 8.5 years. Twenty-eight aneurysms were treated electively and four acutely. The elective cases received dual antiplatelet therapy post-procedure. The acute cases received single antiplatelet therapy post-procedure. Of the target aneurysms, 16/32 (50\%) were small ({$<$}10\,mm), 13/32 (41\%) were large (10-25\,mm) and 3/32 (9\%) were giant ({$\geq$}25\,mm). There was no mortality in the series. There were two periprocedural complications (2/32, 6.2\%): a stroke and a dissection. There were no post-procedural complications. At 6 months post-procedure, satisfactory occlusion (defined as Raymond-Roy 1 or 2) was achieved in 90.6\% and 93.8\% by way of magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography assessment, respectively. There was no implant migration, no significant intraluminal hyperplasia or in-stent stenosis and no cases of aneurysm recurrence. CONCLUSION: The Pipeline Shield has an excellent 6- month safety profile with an acceptable rate of intraprocedural complications, no post-procedure complications and no mortality in this case series of 32 acute and elective cases.},
