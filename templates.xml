        Endovascular Repair of a Ruptured [location] Aneurysm by [procedure type]
 
Staff:
Assists:
Anesthesia:
 
Clinical History: [age] year-old [male/female] ([MRN]) admitted on [admission date] for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) secondary to a ruptured [location] as seen on CT angiogram; Modified Fisher grade [0-4], WFNS grade [1-5]. The patient [has/does not have] a history of previous SAH [, with previous treatment [year] and currently undergoing a [planned/emergency] retreatment]. An external ventricular drain was [not required/required and placed] pre-operatively. Informed consent for a diagnostic cerebral angiogram and aneurysm repair was obtained.
 
Technique:
The patient underwent general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. [Right/Left common femoral, Right/Left radial] artery access was obtained with a [size]-French sheath inserted by the Seldinger technique [under ultrasound guidance]. The [target artery] was selectively catheterized with a diagnostic Berenstein tip catheter through a [guiding catheter] and AP/lateral/3D-rotational angiograms acquired. This demonstrated an aneurysm of the [location] with a maximal diameter of [diameter in mm].
 
[Procedural description]
 
[There were no periprocedural complications. / The procedure was complicated by an intraprocedural aneurysmal rupture causing rebleeding which was managed with temporary balloon inflation for proximal control and coil closure of the rupture point. / The procedure was complicated by an intraprocedural thromboembolic event with visualized occlusion of [involved branch]. After awakening from anesthesia, the patient had attributable [weakness/numbness] in the corresponding distribution to the involved artery.] 

At the end of the procedure all catheters and the balloon were removed. [A 6 Fr | An 8 Fr] Angio-Seal Vascular Closure Device was used to achieve groin haemostasis. The patient woke up with no neurological deficits.
 
Interpretation:
[Successful/Unsuccessful] endovascular [procedure type] for treatment of a ruptured [location] aneurysm. Modified Raymond Roy Class [1-3] result achieved. The patient will require an MRI/MRA during admission.

Endovascular Repair of an Unruptured [location] Aneurysm by [procedure type]
 
Staff:
Assists:
Anesthesia:
 
Clinical History: [age] year-old [male/female] ([MRN]) admitted on [admission date] for elective repair of a [location] aneurysm. The patient [has/does not have] a history of previous SAH. [The last treatment was performed in [year] and the current procedure was [planned/unplanned]]. Informed consent for a diagnostic cerebral angiogram and aneurysm repair was obtained in the clinic. The patient was preloaded on [agents] for [days] days prior to the procedure. WFNS [...]. 
 
Technique:
The patient underwent general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Intravenous heparin was administered throughout the procedure after groin puncture. [Right/Left common femoral, Right/Left radial] artery access was obtained with a [size]-French sheath inserted by the Seldinger technique [under ultrasound guidance]. The [target artery] was selectively catheterized with a diagnostic Berenstein tip catheter through a [guiding catheter] and AP/lateral/3D-rotational angiograms acquired. This demonstrated an aneurysm of the [location] with a maximal diameter of [diameter in mm].
 
[Procedural description]

At the end of the procedure all catheters and the balloon were removed. [A 6 Fr | An 8 Fr] Angio-Seal Vascular Closure Device was used to achieve groin haemostasis. The patient woke up with no neurological deficits.
 
[There were no periprocedural complications. / The procedure was complicated by an intraprocedural aneurysmal rupture causing rebleeding which was managed with temporary balloon inflation for proximal control and coil closure of the rupture point. / The procedure was complicated by an intraprocedural thromboembolic event with visualized occlusion of [involved branch].

Interpretation:
[Successful/Unsuccessful] endovascular [procedure type] for treatment of an unruptured [location] aneurysm. Modified Raymond Roy Class [1-3] result achieved. A follow up MRI/MRA in 6 months should be performed.

Anesthesia:

CLINICAL HISTORY:

 

TECHNIQUE:

Informed consent was obtained from the patient (including risk of stroke and groin haemorrhage).10 ml of 1% lidocaine was infiltrated into the puncture site superficial tissues. A right common femoral artery puncture was performed under ultrasound guidance. A 5 Fr sheath was inserted. A 5 Fr Berenstein catheter was used to perform digital subtraction angiography. Injections were performed of the right vertebral artery, right internal carotid artery, right external carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery, left vertebral artery. [3D flat panel tomographic angiography was performed via the …]. A 6 Fr Angioseal was used to achieve groin haemostasis at the end of the procedure. There were no periprocedural complications. The study was reviewed on table by the attending staff. 

 

FINDINGS:

Comparison is made with the …

 

[Normal cerebral vasculature is demonstrated. No aneurysms or other vascular abnormalities are identified. ]

[A double read of the study will be requested.]

[MDT discussion is recommended.]
