			Endovascular Repair of a Ruptured [location] Aneurysm by [procedure type]
			
			Staff:
			Assists:
			Anesthesia:
			
			Clinical History: [age] year-old [male/female] ([MRN]) admitted on [admission date] for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) secondary to a ruptured [location] as seen on CT angiogram; Modified Fisher grade [0-4], WFNS grade [1-5]. The patient [has/does not have] a history of previous SAH [, with previous treatment [year] and currently undergoing a [planned/emergency] retreatment]. An external ventricular drain was [not required/required and placed] pre-operatively. Informed consent for a diagnostic cerebral angiogram and aneurysm repair was obtained.
			
			Technique:
			The patient underwent general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. [Right/Left common femoral, Right/Left radial] artery access was obtained with a [size]-French sheath inserted by the Seldinger technique [under ultrasound guidance]. The [target artery] was selectively catheterized with a diagnostic Berenstein tip catheter through a [guiding catheter] and AP/lateral/3D-rotational angiograms acquired. This demonstrated an aneurysm of the [location] with a maximal diameter of [diameter in mm].
			
			[Procedural description]
			
			[There were no periprocedural complications. / The procedure was complicated by an intraprocedural aneurysmal rupture causing rebleeding which was managed with temporary balloon inflation for proximal control and coil closure of the rupture point. / The procedure was complicated by an intraprocedural thromboembolic event with visualized occlusion of [involved branch]. After awakening from anesthesia, the patient had attributable [weakness/numbness] in the corresponding distribution to the involved artery.]
			
			At the end of the procedure all catheters and the balloon were removed. [A 6 Fr | An 8 Fr] Angio-Seal Vascular Closure Device was used to achieve groin haemostasis. The patient woke up with no neurological deficits.
			
			Interpretation:
			[Successful/Unsuccessful] endovascular [procedure type] for treatment of a ruptured [location] aneurysm. Modified Raymond Roy Class [1-3] result achieved. The patient will require an MRI/MRA during admission.

			Endovascular Repair of Cerebral Dural Arteriovenous Fistula
			
			Staff:

			Anesthesia: General
			
			Clinical History: [...] year-old male ([...]) admitted on [...] for elective repair of a dural arteriovenous fistula. The patient does not have a history of previous SAH. Informed consent for a diagnostic cerebral angiogram and fistula repair was obtained in the clinic. WFNS 1.
			
			Technique:
			
			The patient underwent general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Intravenous heparin was administered throughout the procedure after groin puncture. [...] common femoral artery access was obtained with a 6-French sheath inserted by the Seldinger technique under ultrasound guidance. A 5 Fr Berenstein catheter used to perform digital subtraction angiography.  Injections were performed of the right vertebral artery, right internal carotid artery, right external carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery, left vertebral artery. [3D flat panel tomographic angiography was performed via the …]. This demonstrated a Cognard 3 dural arteriovenous fistula fed by the left middle meningeal, ascending pharyngeal, and occipital arteries. The [...] external carotid artery was selectively catheterized with a diagnostic Berenstein tip catheter through a Benchmark guiding catheter.
			
			The petrosquamosal branch of the left middle meningeal was selectively catheterised using an Apollo (5 cm detachable tip) microcatheter, which was brought to the level of the fistula. [The same feeding artery was also catheterised with an SL-10 microcatheter, but it was not possible to bring the catheter distal enough to perform a "pressure cooker" technique.] Nevertheless, the catheter wedged in the vessel which most likely reduced the retrograde reflux of Onyx during injection. Onyx was then injected through through the Apollo microcatheter until the fistula was occluded. Final diagnostic angiography confirmed exclusion of the fistula with no distal thromboembolic complications.
			
			At the end of the procedure all catheters and the balloon were removed. A 6 Fr Angio-Seal Vascular Closure Device was used to achieve groin haemostasis. The patient woke up with no neurological deficits. There were no periprocedural complications.
			
			Interpretation:
			
			Successful endovascular treatment of an unruptured dural arteriovenous fistula aneurysm. A follow up cerebral angiogram MRI should be performed at 3 months.

			[A 115 cm Navien 0.058" intermediate catheter was advanced through the sheath in to the distal cervical ICA]. An [SL-10] microcatheter was then navigated across the stenotic level using a 300-cm Synchro Support wire. The microcatheter was removed and a [2.5 x 12 mm Trek-mini] balloon was used to angioplasty the stenosis up to a pressure of [4 ATM]. The balloon was then exchanged again for the microcatheter which was used to deploy a [3x21 mm Neuroform Atlas Stent]. Final angiography revealed improved perfusion of the left cerebral hemisphere.
			
			At the beginning of the procedure the patient's BP was approximately [190 systolic, and the blood pressure was 140 systolic at the end of the procedure]. [An angiogram was performed at this level which showed no evidence of early venous shunting to suggest hyperperfusion syndrome.]
			
			At the end of the procedure all catheters and the balloon were removed. An 8 Fr Angio-Seal Vascular Closure Device was used to achieve groin haemostasis. The patient woke up with no additional neurological deficits. There were no periprocedural complications.
			
			Interpretation:
			
			Successful endovascular angioplasty and stenting of [...]
			
			The case was discussed with the stroke team following the procedure and a maximal BP target of [140 mmHg systolic was recommended].

			Anesthesia: General
			
			
			Clinical History: -year-old female (...) admitted on [...] for elective stenting of a [...] transverse sinus stenosis. The patient has a history of an occluded left transverse sinus secondary to a bony occipital tumour. Informed consent for a diagnostic cerebral angiogram and sinus stenting was obtained. The patient was preloaded on Aspirin and Ticagrelor for 5 days prior to the procedure.
			
			
			
			Technique:
			
			The patient underwent general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Right common femoral artery (5-French sheath) and right common femoral vein (6 French sheath) artery access was obtained by the Seldinger technique under ultrasound guidance. The left internal carotid artery was selectively catheterized with a diagnostic Berenstein tip catheter and AP/lateral angiograms acquired. This demonstrated occlusion of the left transverse sinus and stenosis of the right transverse sinus. The catheter was left in position during the rest of the procedure to acquire further angiograms.
			
			An 8 Fr Cerebase DA Guide Sheath was exchanged for the venous sheath and inserted in to the right internal jugular vein with a diagnostic Berenstein tip catheter. A 6 Fr Navien catheter was brought in to the transverse sinus over a Phenom 0.027" microcatheter and a series of pressure readings (mmH2O) were taken as follows:
			
			Superior sagittal sinus:
			
			Pre-stenotic transverse sinus:
			
			Post-stenotic transverse sinus:
			
			Sigmoid sinus:
			
			Internal jugular vein:
			
			The Cerebrase Guide was then brought in to the transverse sinus over an Advantage Guidewire and a 9x40mm Carotid Wallstent was deployed across the stenosis over a Synchro2 Support Guidewire.
			
			Repeat pressure readings  (mmH2O) were then taken:
			
			Superior sagittal sinus:
			
			Pre-stenotic transverse sinus:
			
			Post-stenotic transverse sinus:
			
			Sigmoid sinus:
			
			Internal jugular vein:
			
			At the end of the procedure all catheters and the balloon were removed. A 6 Fr Angio-Seal Vascular Closure Device and manual pressure was used to achieve groin haemostasis. The patient woke up with no neurological deficits. There were no periprocedural complications.
			
			
			
			Interpretation:
			
			Successful endovascular right transverse sinus stenting for stenosis. The patient should continue on Aspirin and Ticagrelor for 3 months. We will review in clinic in 6 months with a CT Venogram.

			Anesthesia: General
			
			​
			
			TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: The rationale, risks, benefits and alternatives of endovascular treatment were discussed with the patient. It was also discussed that although this is a new procedure it is technically straightforward with a reasonable chance of success.
			
			​
			
			A right common femoral vein puncture was performed under ultrasound guidance. A 6-French sheath was inserted. A 5-French Cobra 2 Glidecath used to catheterize the Azygos vein. ​Digital subtraction venography revealed the Azygos system and the origins of the intercostal veins. Initially an Echelon-10 microcatheter was used to try and cannulate the right T10 intercostal vein origin but this was unsuccessful. Subsequently a 5 cm tip Apollo microcatheter was used to catheterise the relevant level which was then embolized with Onyx-18. ​​
			
			The vascular sheath was removed. 10 minutes of manual compression of the groin achieved haemostasis. There were no procedural complications.
			
			​
			
			Conclusion:​
			
			Successful endovascular transvenous embolization of a right T20 CSF-venous fistula.​

			TECHNICAL: The process of informed consent was completed with the patient. The patient was positioned with a single mattress and no bolsters in a right side down decubitus position markers were applied. With the benefit of local anesthetic a 22-gauge spinal needle was passed by direct posterior approach at the [...] level. Opening pressure was measured at [...] cm of H2O.
			
			Approximately 1 mL of Omnipaque 300 was injected to confirm the intradural position of the needle. Approximately 10 mL preservative-free normal saline was injected slowly over 3 minutes. The patient was then positioned in a head down position by approximately 5°, Subtraction myelography was performed with 12 mL of Omnipaque 300 chased with 5mL of normal saline. Imaging during the injection was performed in the AP view profiling the right lateral gutter of the thecal sac from the lower sacrum to the mid cervical region. [A second injection of 3cc of Omnipaque300 was performed with magnification over the lower thoracic region.]
			
			Following the myelogram the patient was transferred to CT in the right decubitus position and within 15 minutes of the myelogram CT was performed from C2-L3.
			
			FINDINGS:
			
			For the purposes of counting vertebral bodies it should be noted that this patient has 7 cervical segments, 12 thoracic segments each with ribs and 5 lumbar segments, the L5-S1 level demonstrates a small somewhat rudimentary disc.
			
			[A site of dynamic CSF leakage represent a complex appearing CSF-venous fistula was noted beneath the right T9 pedicle (a type III CSF leak). This was seen on DSM. ]
			
			No further areas of leakage were seen on this right decubitus myelogram within the cervical and thoracic region to the level of L3.The fistula was not localized on CT.
