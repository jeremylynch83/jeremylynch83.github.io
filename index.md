        [Interventional Neuroradiology](inr.html) (also known as neurointervention, neurointerventional surgery, and endovascular neurosurgery) is a medical specialty employing image guided technologies in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the head, neck, and spine. It is a relatively new discipline that is rapidly growing in popularity partly due to its capability to treat serious diseases in a less invasive manner than previously possible. This website, written by practicing neurointerventionalists, provides evidence-based and comprehensive information about the specialty and the diseases which it is able to treat.
