abstract = {Background A carotid web can be defined as an endoluminal shelf-like projection often noted at the origin of the internal carotid artery (ICA) just beyond the bifurcation. Diagnosis of a carotid web as an underlying cause of recurrent ischemic stroke is infrequent and easily misdiagnosed as an atheromatous plaque. Surgery has traditionally been used to resect symptomatic lesions while there is no enough evidence supporting medical therapy as the sole management. To our knowledge there is only one report about carotid artery stenting (CAS) as a definite management of carotid web and no previous reports of acute large-vessel occlusions undergoing mechanical thrombectomy in the setting of carotid web as the etiology. Case report We report two cases: The first presented with recurrent ischemic stroke in the same arterial territory and the other with an emergent left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion that underwent endovascular mechanical thrombectomy in which initial computed tomographic angiograms (CTA) suggested carotid web etiologies. Following confirmation with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), both patients ultimately underwent endovascular carotid stenting instead of surgical resection for definitive carotid web treatment. Conclusions Carotid webs are a rare cause of ischemic stroke in young and middle-aged adults that can readily be identified by CTA. Endovascular management may include emergent mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel thromboembolic complications, and for definitive treatment with carotid stenting across the carotid web as an alternative to surgical resection and medical management for secondary stroke prevention.},

abstract = {Carotid artery web is considered an exceptional cause of recurrent ischemic strokes in the affected arterial territory. The underlying pathology proposed for this entity is an atypical fibromuscular dysplasia. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with no cardiovascular risk factors who had experienced 2 cryptogenic ischemic strokes in the same arterial territory within an 11-month period. Although all diagnostic tests initially yielded normal results, detailed analysis of the computed tomography angiography images revealed a carotid web; catheter angiography subsequently confirmed the diagnosis. Carotid surgery was performed, since which time the patient has remained completely asymptomatic. The histological finding of intimal hyperplasia is consistent with previously reported cases of carotid artery web. Carotid artery web is an infrequent cause of stroke, and this diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion plus a detailed analysis of vascular imaging studies.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: Carotid webs are intraluminal filling defects at the carotid bulb which are considered rare, though possibly underappreciated entities with recent studies demonstrating a likely casual association with ischemic stroke. The purpose of the study is to describe our recent experience with clinical and imaging manifestations of carotid webs. Materials and methods: A retrospective review of CTA neck studies in all adult patients presenting to our institution during the 19-month study interval was performed to determine the presence of carotid webs. Subsequent chart review of these patients with webs was performed to assess their clinical history and to obtain demographic detail. Results: A total of 14 patients were identified with carotid webs in the study population. The mean age of patients with webs was 42.1 years (range: 28–54), consisting mostly of African Americans (86%) and females (64%). Ten (71%) of web patients had a history of ischemic stroke, each ipsilateral to the side of web, and at least four of these patients had recurrent ischemic stroke. Conclusion: We provide one of the largest sample sizes of webs gathered in a single study. Given its association with ischemic stroke, carotid webs should be assessed for in all patients presenting with ischemic stroke, especially younger African Americans.},

abstract = {Background: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) can cause symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), but the estimated risks are imprecise and predictors remain uncertain. We aimed to obtain precise estimates and predictors of the risk of ICH during untreated follow-up in an individual patient data meta-analysis. Methods: We invited investigators of published cohorts of people aged at least 16 years, identified by a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE and Embase from inception to April 30, 2015, to provide individual patient data on clinical course from CCM diagnosis until first CCM treatment or last available follow-up. We used survival analysis to estimate the 5-year risk of symptomatic ICH due to CCMs (primary outcome), multivariable Cox regression to identify baseline predictors of outcome, and random-effects models to pool estimates in a meta-analysis. Findings: Among 1620 people in seven cohorts from six studies, 204 experienced ICH during 5197 person-years of follow-up (Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year risk 15{\textperiodcentered}8%, 95% CI 13{\textperiodcentered}7-17{\textperiodcentered}9). The primary outcome of ICH within 5 years of CCM diagnosis was associated with clinical presentation with ICH or new focal neurological deficit (FND) without brain imaging evidence of recent haemorrhage versus other modes of presentation (hazard ratio 5{\textperiodcentered}6, 95% CI 3{\textperiodcentered}2-9{\textperiodcentered}7) and with brainstem CCM location versus other locations (4{\textperiodcentered}4, 2{\textperiodcentered}3-8{\textperiodcentered}6), but age, sex, and CCM multiplicity did not add independent prognostic information. The 5-year estimated risk of ICH during untreated follow-up was 3{\textperiodcentered}8% (95% CI 2{\textperiodcentered}1-5{\textperiodcentered}5) for 718 people with non-brainstem CCM presenting without ICH or FND, 8{\textperiodcentered}0% (0{\textperiodcentered}1-15{\textperiodcentered}9) for 80 people with brainstem CCM presenting without ICH or FND, 18{\textperiodcentered}4% (13{\textperiodcentered}3-23{\textperiodcentered}5) for 327 people with non-brainstem CCM presenting with ICH or FND, and 30{\textperiodcentered}8% (26{\textperiodcentered}3-35{\textperiodcentered}2) for 495 people with brainstem CCM presenting with ICH or FND. Interpretation: Mode of clinical presentation and CCM location are independently associated with ICH within 5 years of CCM diagnosis. These findings can inform decisions about CCM treatment.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - The purpose of this article is to describe "cerebral proliferative angiopathy" (CPA) as a clinical entity, which may be regarded as separate from "classical" brain AVMs in angioarchitecture, natural history, clinical presentation, and, therefore, treatment and which can be discerned from other cerebral AVMs by characteristic imaging features. METHODS - In a prospectively entered databank encompassing 1434 patients with brain AVMs, a subgroup of 49 patients harboring specific angiographic characteristics were identified. Their charts and imaging films were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS - We found a preponderance of CPA in young (mean age: 22) females (67%). Clinical symptoms were seizures, disabling headaches, and stroke-like symptoms; hemorrhagic presentations were exceptional. On cross-sectional imaging, CPA demonstrated as a diffuse network of densely enhancing vascular spaces with intermingled normal brain parenchyma. The discrepancy between the large size of the nidus and the small shunting volume, the absence of flow-related aneurysms, the presence of diffuse angiogenesis (eg, transdural supply, progressive arterial occlusion), and the small calibre of a multitude of feeding arteries and draining veins were the angiographic hallmarks of this disease. CONCLUSION - The diffuse angiogenetic activity is presumably related to reduced perinidal perfusion and subsequent chronic cortical ischemia. Natural history demonstrates a low risk of hemorrhage. CPA may be regarded as a separate clinical entity different to "classical" cerebral AVMs, because normal brain is interspersed with the abnormal vascular channels increasing the risk of neurological deficit in aggressive treatments, which in the light of the natural history does not seem to be indicated. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {This study investigated the imaging and clinical features of cervical artery web to improve disease diagnosis. Imaging and clinical data of 41 patients with cervical artery web were retrospectively analyzed and summarized in the context of the literature. Of the 8653 patients who underwent carotid computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the past 3 years at our hospital, 41 (0.47%) were diagnosed with cervical artery web. Among the 41 patients, there were 38 web structures in typical position, including 26 web structures located in the internal carotid artery and 12 in the proximal bifurcation of the common carotid artery. And the other three web structures were located outside carotid artery, including two in the subclavian artery and one in the vertebral artery. There were 47 web structures in 41 cases of cervical artery web; 35/41 (85.3%) were unilateral and 6/41 (14.7%) were bilateral. Among 41 patients, there were 20 patients who had cerebral infarction, 14 who experienced transient ischemic attack, 3 patients with cerebral hemorrhage; and 4 with other manifestations. Cervical artery web showed typical imaging features in the carotid CTA. Cervical artery web was most common in the internal carotid artery and at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. It was also occasionally found in other rare artery such as vertebral and subclavian artery. Based on the various locations of web structure, we think it is necessary to rename carotid web as cervical artery web. Most of the attachment sites of the web structures were located in the posterior wall of the lumen, followed by the lateral wall; sites on the anterior wall were rare. Cervical artery web may be an underappreciated risk factor for stroke. And hypertension can increase the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with cervical artery web.},

Head and neck localizations of HHT are recurrent, frequent associated with serious complications. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and imaging patterns of neurological involvement in HHT and to discuss the role of interventional radiology in the management of HHT patients. Based on a multidisciplinary experience of twenty years at our center, we report here the different aspects of neurological involvement of HHT. Depending on the genetic type of the disease, vascular abnormalities may affect different organs. The knowledge of neurological involvement according to specific localization of HHT makes detection easier. As cerebral or spinal arteriovenous fistula may be present in patients with epistaxis or pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), radiologists should be able to detect high-risk lesions and prevent related complications. Finally, we review indications and techniques of embolization for hemorrhagic lesions and emphasize that endovascular therapies are very effective and safe in experienced hands. Head and neck imaging is commonly used for the diagnosis of HHT. Imaging plays also a key role for patient evaluation before treatment as pluridisciplinary management is needed.},

METHODS: A search was made of the MEDLINE databases for the MeSH term, "Video Games," combined with the terms "Surgical Procedures, Operative," "Endoscopy," "Robotics," "Education," "Learning," "Simulators," "Computer Simulation," "Psychomotor Performance," and "Surgery, Computer-Assisted,"encompassing all journal articles before November 2009. References of articles were searched for further studies. RESULTS: Twelve relevant journal articles were discovered. Video game usage has been studied in relationship to laparoscopic, gastrointestinal endoscopic, endovascular, and robotic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Video game users acquire endoscopic but not robotic techniques quicker, and training on video games appears to improve performance.

abstract = {Background and purpose It is classically thought that the internal cerebral veins (ICV) do not communicate with the venous pouch of vein of Galen malformations (VGM). We report on the anatomy of the deep venous system in VGM with special emphasis on the drainage of the ICV and possible changes after endovascular treatment. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed DSA and 2D time-of-flight MR venograms of 55 children with VGM. We evaluated all pre-and post-operative images for the presence of the ICVs and determined their route of venous drainage. Results Of 55 children, pre-operative 2D MRV detected the ICVs in 19 cases (35%) compared with one case (2%) for pre-embolization DSA (2%) (P<0.0001). Of the cases in which the ICVs were seen preoperatively, in 15 cases (78.9%) the ICV drained directly into the VGM while in the other four cases, the ICV used alternative venous drainage routes. On post-operative MRV, the ICVs were seen in 17 cases (31%) on MRV and 10 cases (18.2%) on DSA with drainage into an adult-like vein of Galen in 13 cases (76%), respectively (P=0.08). In four cases normal ICV drainage into the vein of Galen was seen even when the venous sac was closed. In two cases there was a change in ICV drainage from the vein of Galen to the lateral mesencephalic vein. Conclusion The communication of the ICV with the VGM is a common phenomenon. Different changes of venous drainage routes do occur after treatment and are best seen on MRV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to examine carotid webs (intimal variant fibromuscular dysplasia) by studying their clinical features and imaging profiles. METHODS: All patients (n = 893) of the Department of Neurology at Beijing Tiantan Hospital between January and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed for computed tomography angiography (CTA), high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI), and Doppler ultrasound data. Carotid webs were identified by two experienced neuroimaging experts according to the characteristics of a thin intraluminal filling defect along the posterior wall of the carotid bulb on sagittal CTA and a septum structure in arteries on axial CTA. RESULTS: We found eight carotid web patients by CTA and Doppler ultrasound. Four of eight (50%) carotid webs were observed in the bilateral carotid arteries and other four of eight (50%) were ipsilateral. The mean age of the 8 patients was 50.75 (range 38-65) years; two were in women. Six of 8 patients (75%) with carotid webs had acute ischemic stroke. Two-thirds of patients with ischemic stroke were treated with carotid revascularization. Doppler ultrasound indicated that the septum projected into the carotid arteries in all patients. Half of the carotid web patients underwent HRMRI, showing features consistent with CTA findings. The Cohen's kappa coefficient for interobserver agreement in diagnosing carotid webs was.76. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler ultrasound combined with CTA and HRMRI is effective and reliable method to identifying carotid webs, which may be associated with stroke.},

abstract = {Background: We report a symptomatic carotid web successfully treated with carotid endarterectomy. A healthy 43-year-old woman presented with acute-onset left-sided weakness. Carotid web was evident on computed tomography angiography as a focal filling defect in the right common carotid artery. This right common carotid artery web extended into the ICA created an eddy resulting in turbulent flow. Subsequent acute embolus formation led to embolization and acute stroke. Method: Review of the literature was performed using Medline Plus and PubMed databases. Result: The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy with primary closure. Procedure was well tolerated and there was an uneventful recovery. Conclusion: Arterial webs are a rare arteriopathy and a usual arrangement of fibromuscular intralumenal in-growth with unclear etiology. It is however, an important potential etiology of stroke in patients without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. Carotid web and atypical carotid fibromuscular dysplasia should be considered in young, otherwise healthy patients presenting with stroke and without the typical risk factors for atherosclerotic carotid disease and stroke.},

abstract = {Background and purpose Transarterial Onyx embolization is an effective treatment for patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). A study was performed to determine whether the clinical and radiological outcomes after transarterial Onyx treatment were affected by the type of cortical venous drainage (direct vs indirect) of high-grade DAVF. Materials and methods Between May 2006 and December 2014, demographic data, clinical presentation, angiographic characteristics, and treatment-related outcomes were collected for 54 patients divided into two groups (intracranial DAVF with direct and indirect cortical venous drainage). Continuous variables were compared with the two-tailed t test and categorical variables with the and Dagger; 2 test. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Results Fifty-two patients (71% with direct and 29% with indirect cortical venous drainage) underwent Onyx embolization. Immediate complete occlusion after treatment was observed in about 55% of patients without between-group difference. During the long-term follow-up, complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 83% of patients. Specifically, 15 additional patients (40%) in the direct cortical venous drainage group progressed to complete occlusion, but only one (6%) in the indirect cortical venous drainage group. Overall, the rate of complete occlusion was higher in patients with DAVF with direct cortical venous drainage (92%) than in those with DAVF with indirect cortical venous drainage (62.5%) (P=0.01). The rate of permanent treatment-related complications was 4%, mostly related to ischemic events. Overall, 80.5% of patients had a good neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). Conclusions Transarterial Onyx embolization of intracranial high-grade DAVF is safe and effective, particularly for lesions with direct cortical venous drainage.},

abstract = {Background: Inventing an optimal curve on a microcatheter is required for successful intracranial aneurysm coiling. Shaping microcatheters for vertebrobasilar artery aneurysm coiling is difficult because of the vessel's long, tortuous and mobile anatomy. To overcome this problem, we devised a new method of shaping the microcatheter by using the patient's specific vessel anatomy and the highly shapable microcatheter. We report our preliminary results of treating posterior circulation aneurysms by this method. Methods: An unshaped microcatheter (Excelsior XT-17; Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) was pretreated by exposure to the patient's vessel for five minutes. The microcatheter was placed in the vicinity of the targeted aneurysm and was left in contact with the patient's vessel before extraction. This treatment precisely formed a curve on the microcatheter shaft identical to the patient's vessel anatomy. Following the pretreatment, the tip of the microcatheter was steam shaped according to the long axis of the target aneurysm. Five consecutive vertebrobasilar aneurysms were treated using this shaping method and evaluated for the clinical and anatomical outcomes and microcatheter accuracy and stability. Results: All of the designed microcatheters matched the vessel and aneurysm anatomy except in one case that required a single modification. All aneurysms were successfully catheterized without the assistance of a microguidewire, and matched the long axis of the aneurysm. All microcatheters retained stability until the end of the procedure. Conclusions: A precise microcatheter shaping for a vertebrobasilar artery aneurysm may be achieved by using the patient's actual vessel anatomy and the highly shapable microcatheter.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid webs may cause recurrent ischemic stroke. We describe the prevalence, demographics, clinical presentation, imaging features, histopathology, and stroke risk associated with this under-recognized lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A carotid web was defined on CTA as a thin intraluminal filling defect along the posterior wall of the carotid bulb just beyond the carotid bifurcation on oblique sagittal section CTA that was seen as a septum on axial CTA. Using a prospective case series from April 2013 to April 2014, we describe the demographics, spectrum of imaging features on CTA, and histopathology of these carotid webs. From a retrospective analysis of patients at our center from May 2012 to April 2013 who had a baseline head and neck CTA followed by a brain MR imaging within 1-2 days of the CTA, we determine the period prevalence of carotid webs and the prevalence of ipsilateral stroke on imaging. RESULTS: In the prospective series, the mean age was 50 years (range, 41-55 years); 5/7 patients were women. Recurrent stroke was seen in 5/7 (71.4%) patients with the carotid web; time to recurrence ranged from 1 to 97 months. Histopathology suggested a high probability of fibromuscular dysplasia. In the retrospective series, carotid webs were seen in 7/576 patients for a hospital-based-period prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI, 0.4%-2.5%). Two of these 7 patients had acute stroke in the vascular territory of the carotid web. CONCLUSIONS: A carotid web may contribute to recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with no other determined stroke mechanism. Intimal variant fibromuscular dysplasia is the pathologic diagnosis in most cases. The prevalence of carotid web is low, while the optimal management strategy remains unknown.},

abstract = {Background: Carotid webs are luminal, shelf-like protrusions at the carotid bulb. Considered to be a variant of fibromuscular dysplasia, carotid webs have been observed principally in African American females. The association between carotid webs and recurrent ischemic strokes continues to be established as patients without traditional stroke risk factors are found to have carotid webs as the only possible cause of symptomatic deficits. The majority of patients undergo endarterectomy; few stent placements are reported. We present the case of an African American female who underwent stent placement for treatment and secondary prevention of stroke attributed to a carotid web. Case Report: A 33-year-old African American female presented with acute onset left hemiparesis and left facial droop. Alteplase was administered; multiphase head and neck computed tomography angiography revealed an occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery with a web at the carotid bulb. Aspiration catheter thrombectomy achieved a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of 3. She was placed on 2 antiplatelet agents, and 3 weeks later she underwent stent placement. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography at 3 months showed obliteration of the right carotid artery web and satisfactory integration of the stent into the vessel wall. She was reassessed at 1 year and reported no neurologic symptoms. Conclusion: Although carotid webs are most commonly treated with endarterectomy, they may be amenable to stent therapy with favorable clinical outcomes as shown with this patient.},

abstract = {Object There have been many multidisciplinary approaches to the treatment of vein of Galen malformations. Endovascular embolization is the first option for treatment. However, the effects of the treatment remain controversial. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of endovascular embolization to treat patients with vein of Galen malformations. Methods This paper includes a retrospective analysis of a sample of 667 patients who underwent endovascular embolization to treat vein of Galen malformations. The data were obtained through a literature search of PubMed databases. The authors also evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment. Mortality within the follow-up period is analyzed. Pooled estimates of proportions with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using raw (i.e., untransformed) proportions (PRAW). Results In the 34 studies evaluated, neonates accounted for 44% of the sample (95% CI 31%-57%; I2 = 92.5%), infants accounted for 41% (95% CI 30%-51%; I2 = 83.3%), and children and adults accounted for 12% (95% CI 7%-16%; I2 = 52.9%). The meta-analysis revealed that complete occlusion was performed in 57% (95% CI 48%-65%; I2 = 68.2%) of cases, with partial occlusion in 43% (95% CI 34%-51%; I2 = 70.7%). The pooled proportion of patients showing a good outcome was 68% (95% CI 61%-76%; I2 = 77.8%), while 31% showed a poor outcome (95% CI 24%-38%; I2 = 75.6%). The proportional meta-analysis showed that postembolization mortality and complications were reported in 10% (95% CI 8%-12%; I2 = 42.8%) and 37% (95% CI 29%-45%; I2 = 79.1%), respectively. Complications included cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia, hydrocephalus, leg ischemia, and vessel perforation. Conclusions The successful treatment of vein of Galen malformations remains a complex therapeutic challenge. The authors' analysis of clinical history and research literature suggests that vein of Galen malformations treated with endovascular embolization can result in an acceptable mortality rate, complications, and good clinical outcome. Future large-scale, multicenter, randomized trials are necessary to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {The carotid web is a proposed stroke mechanism that may underlie cryptogenic stroke, particularly in younger patients without vascular risk factors. The web appears as a shelf-like projection into the lumen of the proximal cervical internal carotid artery without evidence of calcification. It is pathologically defined as intimal fibromuscular dysplasia. Altered haemodynamics distal to the web cause flow stagnation and remote embolisation of fibrin-based clots. It is best demonstrated and diagnosed on CT angiography (CTA) of the neck because of its ability to resolve calcium and create multiplanar reconstructions. Although they can be readily visualised on CTA, carotid webs may be missed or misinterpreted because they do not typically cause haemodynamically significant stenosis and can mimic arterial dissection, non-calcified atherosclerotic plaque and intraluminal thrombus. Options for management include antiplatelet therapy, carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting. Modern management strategies for cryptogenic stroke include long-Term cardiac monitoring, further investigation for structural cardiac disease and a diagnostic workup for arterial hypercoagulability, however, these strategies are not likely to capture the possibility of a carotid web. Carotid webs should be suspected in a young patient presenting with recurrent unihemispheric strokes particularly when conventional vascular risk factors are not present.},

abstract = {Background: The introduction of Onyx has led us to adopt a new treatment approach for brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), using endovascular embolization with Onyx as the first line treatment with a curative intent. The aim of the present report is to evaluate our results using this strategy, with special emphasis on angiographic characteristics affecting treatment risks and success rates. Methods: From October 2006 to December 2009, 92 consecutive patients harboring brain AVM were treated with Onyx during 177 procedures. Results: Endovascular treatments were completed in 68 out of 92 patients. Median number of procedures was two. Complete obliteration using embolization exclusively was achieved in 25 patients, resulting in a 37 % cure rate in patients who concluded treatments (25/68), and 27 % in the cohort. In Spetzler-Martin grades 1 & 2 AVMs, complete obliteration was achieved in 48 % of the cases. Complete obliteration rates were significantly higher in lesions with superficial big feeding arteries. There were 15 bleeding complications during 177 embolization sessions (8.4 % per procedure); seven cases resolved in less than 3 months. Permanent disability rate was 6.5 %; mortality rate was 2.2 %. Bleeding was related to the use of the microcatheter/guidewire in six cases and to the use of the embolization material in nine, the amount of Onyx injected was significantly higher in those nine cases. Conclusions: Embolization of brain AVM using Onyx and detachable tip microcatheters results in a relatively high rate of complete obliteration. Angioarchitecture of the lesion can predict treatment success. Higher amounts of Onyx injected per session increase the bleeding risk. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.},

The underlying pathophysiology of edema and hemorrhage after AVM resection still remains controversial. Over the last three decades, advances in neuroimaging, CBF, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) measurement have both favored and contradicted the NBBP theory.

abstract = {Introduction: Carotid web is a radiographic entity located in the posterior aspect of the origin of the internal carotid arteries, considered to be a pathologic equivalent to intimal fibromuscular dysplasia, and has been implicated in acute ischemic strokes. The mechanism underlying its development is unknown and it remains unclear if this lesion is congenital or acquired. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of carotid webs in a pediatric population with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: A retrospective review of neck CTA, MRA, or DSA images in a pediatric population with acute ischemic stroke was performed to determine the occurrence of carotid webs. Two fellowship-trained neurointerventionists performed independent vascular imaging review. Results: We identified forty-seven cases of childhood acute ischemic stroke (55% male; median age, 9 years). Congenital heart disease, sickle cell disease, infection, and recent head/neck trauma were the most common risk factors. Eight of the ischemic stroke cases were located in multiple vascular territories. Neck arterial imaging was undertaken in twenty-four patients. No carotid webs were detected in the studied pediatric stroke population. (The correlation coefficient for the determination of webs was Kappa = 1.00; p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study failed to find evidence that carotid webs are congenital. More studies are needed for a better understanding of carotid web origin, natural evolution, and the potential implications for treatment.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this review was to provide an up-to-date summarization of available Food and Drug Administration-approved vascular closure devices (VCDs) and to analyze current evidence comparing individual devices with one another and with manual compression (MC). The review includes indications for use, advantages and disadvantages, safety and efficacy, and outcomes. Methods: A review of literature available on VCDs was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE. Only clinical trials published within the last 10 years evaluating the efficacy of different VCDs with access obtained through common femoral artery or vein were included. All literature included in this review was published in English and used human participants. Results: The search strategy yielded 34 relevant articles. These studies included procedures ranging from diagnostic catheterizations to percutaneous endovascular aneurysm repair. There is considerable heterogeneity in the studies, with a wide variety of definitions and different outcome measures. The review demonstrated that VCDs provided improvement in the patients' comfort and satisfaction as well as in the time to hemostasis and ambulation. Most studies are underpowered to show differences, but even after meta-analysis or Cochrane review, complication rates as well as safety and efficacy between devices and MC remained comparable. Conclusions: VCDs have shown marked improvement in patients' comfort and satisfaction as well as in time to hemostasis and ambulation after percutaneous vascular procedures. According to multiple small randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and a Cochrane review, complication rates, safety and efficacy, and outcomes remain comparable between VCDs and MC (12% for VCDs vs 13% for MC). VCDs have a low incidence of major complications and high success rates, which provides convenience for the practitioner and facilitates turnover of patients. VCDs have a risk of infectious (0.6% with VCDs vs 0.2% with MC) and thrombotic complications (0.3% with VCDs vs none with MC) that is small but may be increased compared with MC. It is important to balance the goals of comfort of the patient, resources of the staff, and early ambulation against periprocedural and anatomic risk factors (ie, individualize use of VCDs to specific clinical scenarios). Users must be familiar with a device and its limitations to safely and effectively achieve hemostasis after femoral artery puncture.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: Carotid webs are intraluminal shelf-like filling defects at the carotid bulb with recently recognized implications in patients with recurrent ischemic stroke. We sought to determine whether carotid webs are an under-recognized cause of "cryptogenic" ischemic stroke and to estimate their prevalence in the general population. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of neck CTA studies in young patients with cryptogenic stroke over the past 6 years (n=33) was performed to determine the prevalence of carotid webs compared with a control group of patients who received neck CTA studies for reasons other than ischemic stroke (n = 63). Results: The prevalence of carotid webs in the cryptogenic stroke population was 21.2% (95% CI, 8.9%-38.9%). Patients with symptomatic carotid webs had a mean age of 38.9 years (range, 30-48 years) and were mostly African American (86%) and women (86%). In contrast, only 1.6% (95% CI, 0%-8.5%) of patients in the control group demonstrated a web. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant association between carotid webs and ischemic stroke (OR = 16.7; 95% CI, 2.78-320.3; P = .01). Conclusions: Carotid webs exhibit a strong association with ischemic stroke, and their presence should be suspected in patients lacking other risk factors, particularly African American women.},

@article{Mosimann2018,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Since the first landmark randomized trials on unruptured bAVMs were published, there has been emerging concerns about the role of endovascular therapy. For bAVMs considered inoperable, embolization remains an option worth considering, especially in young patients presenting with a rupture. We aimed to review the curative potential of contemporary stand-alone embolization techniques enabling high occlusion rates and their respective short and long term safety profile. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a PubMed search with the terms "curative embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations" and "endovascular cure of brain arteriovenous malformations" focusing on the last ten years (2008-2018) and compliant to the PRISMA reporting guidelines. We then screened the prospective and retrospective studies of pediatric or adult populations that contained patient demographics, ruptured or unruptured presentation, and bAVM grade according to the Spetzler-Martin (SM) classification, exclusive or stand-alone endovascular treatment without previous embolization, micro-, radio-or stereotactic surgery, number of sessions, type of access, technique(s) and embolic agents used, rate of angiographically confirmed complete occlusion at least 3 months after obliteration stratified by AVM grade or subtype, as well as neurological status and treatment-associated outcome based on the modified Rankin scale at admission, discharge and within 12 months following curative embolization, rated by an independent observer. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Given the heterogeneity of the reported data, multiple confounding factors, overwhelming number of unpowered studies, lack of homogenous control groups and poor compliance to PRISMA reporting guidelines in most of the interventional literature, we were unable to obtain solid data and perform a statistical meta-analysis on the safety and effectiveness of curative embolization. Consequently, we decided to cover a selection of salient topics. CONCLUSIONS: Stand-alone curative embolization, as well as exclusive microsurgery or radiosurgery each play complementary roles. Hemorrhagic, deep-seated lesions are an interesting subtype of surgically unfavorable bAVMs that may benefit from exclusive transvenous embolization, when carefully selected. Larger randomized trials and prospective registries are needed to establish the place of stand-alone or neoadjuvant endovascular treatment.},

abstract = {Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by epistaxis, telangiectases, and multi-organ vascular dysplasia. Head and neck localizations of HHT are recurrent, frequent associated with serious complications. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and imaging patterns of neurological involvement in HHT and to discuss the role of interventional radiology in the management of HHT patients. Based on a multidisciplinary experience of twenty years at our center, we report here the different aspects of neurological involvement of HHT. Depending on the genetic type of the disease, vascular abnormalities may affect different organs. The knowledge of neurological involvement according to specific localization of HHT makes detection easier. As cerebral or spinal arteriovenous fistula may be present in patients with epistaxis or pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), radiologists should be able to detect high-risk lesions and prevent related complications. Finally, we review indications and techniques of embolization for hemorrhagic lesions and emphasize that endovascular therapies are very effective and safe in experienced hands. Head and neck imaging is commonly used for the diagnosis of HHT. Imaging plays also a key role for patient evaluation before treatment as pluridisciplinary management is needed.},

abstract = {Background: An understanding of the present standing of surgery, surgical results and the role in altering the future morbidity and mortality of untreated brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) is appropriate considering the myriad alternative management pathways (including radiosurgery, embolization or some combination of treatments), varying risks and selection biases that have contributed to confusion regarding management. The purpose of this review is to clarify the link between the incidence of adverse outcomes that are reported from a management pathway of either surgery or no intervention with the projected risks of surgery or no intervention. Methods: A critical review of the literature was performed on the outcomes of surgery and non-intervention for bAVM. An analysis of the biases and how these may have influenced the outcomes was included to attempt to identify reasonable estimates of risks. Results: In the absence of treatment, the cumulative risk of future hemorrhage is approximately 16% and 29% at 10 and 20 years after diagnosis of bAVM without hemorrhage and 35% and 45% at 10 and 20 years when presenting with hemorrhage (annualized, this risk would be approximately 1.8% for unruptured bAVMs and 4.7% for 8 years for bAVMs presenting with hemorrhage followed by the unruptured bAVM rate). The cumulative outcome of these hemorrhages depends upon whether the patient remains untreated and is allowed to have a further hemorrhage or is treated at this time. Overall, approximately 42% will develop a new permanent neurological deficit or death from a hemorrhagic event. The presence of an associated proximal intracranial aneurysm (APIA) and restriction of venous outflow may increase the risk for subsequent hemorrhage. Other risks for increased risk of hemorrhage (age, pregnancy, female) were examined, and their purported association with hemorrhage is difficult to support. Both the Spetzler-Martin grading system (and its compaction into the Spetzler-Ponce tiers) and Lawton-Young supplementary grading system are excellent in predicting the risk of surgery. The 8-year risk of unfavorable outcome from surgery (complication leading to a permanent new neurological deficit with a modified Rankin Scale score of greater than one, residual bAVM or recurrence) is dependent on bAVM size, the presence of deep venous drainage (DVD) and location in critical brain (eloquent location). For patients with bAVMs who have neither a DVD nor eloquent location, the 8-year risk for an unfavorable outcome increases with size (increasing from 1 cm to 6 cm) from 1% to 9%. For patients with bAVM who have either a DVD or eloquent location (but not both), the 8-year risk for an unfavorable outcome increases with the size (increasing from 1 cm to 6 cm) from 4% to 35%. For patients with bAVM who have both a DVD and eloquent location, the 8-year risk for unfavorable outcome increases with size (increasing from 1 cm to 3 cm) from 12% to 38%. Conclusion: Patients with a Spetzler-Ponce A bAVM expecting a good quality of life for the next 8 years are likely to do better with surgery in expert centers than remaining untreated. Ongoing research is urgently required on the outcome of management pathways for bAVM.},

The optimal medical and surgical strategies for managing these lesions have not been well established. We report a single-center case series of carotid stenting for treatment of symptomatic carotid webs. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing stent placement for treatment of symptomatic carotid webs were included. Carotid webs were defined as a thin intraluminal filling defect along the posterior wall of the carotid bulb just beyond the carotid bifurcation on CTA. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, antiplatelet management, clinical presentation, imaging findings, treatment characteristics, complications, and stroke recurrence rates. Descriptive statistics are reported. Results: A total of 4 patients were treated. Their mean age was 44 years (range 30–50). Three patients were female and 1 was male. All patients were symptomatic presenting with ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks or stroke. Patients were placed on dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor and aspirin prior to the procedure. There were no ischemic or hemorrhagic complications. Three patients had postoperative bradycardia, 1 of whom required atropine immediately following stenting. No patients had recurrent ischemic events. Conclusions: Stent placement for treatment of carotid webs can be performed safely. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND A number of smartphone medical apps have recently emerged that may be helpful for the neurosurgical patient, practitioner, and trainee. This study aims to review the current neurosurgery-focused apps available for the iPhone, iPad, and Android platforms as of December 2013. METHODS Two of the most popular smartphone app stores (Apple Store and Android Google Play Store) were surveyed for neurosurgery-focused apps in December 2013. Search results were categorized based on their description page. Data were collected on price, rating, app release date, target audience, and medical professional involvement in app design. A review of the top apps in each category was performed. RESULTS The search resulted in 111 unique apps, divided into these 7 categories: 16 (14%) clinical tools, 17 (15%) conference adjunct, 27 (24%) education, 18 (16%) literature, 15 (14%) marketing, 10 (9%) patient information, and 8 (7%) reference. The average cost of paid apps was $23.06 (range: $0.99-89.99). Out of the 111 apps, 71 (64%) were free, 48 (43%) had reviews, and 14 (13%) had more than 10 reviews. Seventy-three (66%) apps showed evidence of medical professional involvement. The number of apps being released every year has been increasing since 2009. CONCLUSIONS There are a number of neurosurgery-themed apps available to all audiences. There was a lack of patient information apps for nonspinal procedures. Most apps did not have enough reviews to evaluate their quality. There was also a lack of oversight to validate the accuracy of medical information provided in these apps.},

abstract = {Overwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal. Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic reviews. Recent methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs. During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement. After an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further revised and is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only recently received recognition, such as selective outcome reporting bias. This explanatory and elaboration document-intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement-has also been extensively revised. It presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item providing examples of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies. Several examples of flow diagrams are included. The CONSORT 2010 Statement, this revised explanatory and elaboration document, and the associated website (www.consort-statement.org) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of randomised trials.},

abstract = {We describe a 47-year-old female patient with a carotid web and ischemic stroke. A carotid web is a membrane-like shelf of tissue, predominantly affecting the intimal layer of the arterial wall, usually extending from the posterolateral wall of the carotid artery into the lumen, typically at the origin of the internal carotid artery just beyond the bifurcation. It is considered to be an under-recognized etiology of ischemic stroke in young and middle-aged patients. Typically, these patients do not show any coexistent or only few vascular risk factors. Digital subtraction angiography, computer tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and color-coded duplex sonography are able to identify carotid webs. Therapy strategies include conservative therapy with intake of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, or carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. Optimal therapy strategy remains open. A considerable rate of recurrent cerebrovascular ischemic events has been reported in patients with a symptomatic carotid web and conservative therapy.

Materials and All patients (n = 500) of the Multicenter Randomized Methods: Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) in whom the carotid bifurcation could be assessed (n = 443) were included. The presence of a carotid web at the carotid bifurcations was evaluated at computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and imaging baseline characteristics were presented by descriptive statistics for patients with an identified carotid web. Interobserver agreement in the detection of carotid webs was examined by using kappa statistics. Results: Eleven (2.5%) carotid webs were found at the symptomatic side and two (0.5%) carotid webs were found at the asymptomatic side. Ten (91%) patients with a symptomatic carotid web were female. Nine patients with a symptomatic carotid web did not have major risk factors or other causes for ischemic stroke (82%). Fair to good interobserver agreement (k, 0.72) was observed for diagnosing carotid webs at CT angiography. Conclusion: Carotid webs at the symptomatic carotid bifurcation were observed in 2.5% of the patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion and were mostly diagnosed in female patients with a fair to good interobserver agreement.},

This study aimed to obtain a better description of CaFMD in Afro-Caribbean population, who could be particularly affected by it.
Methods - This study included consecutive patients <55 years consulting at Fort-de-France University Hospital Stroke Center (Martinique, FWI) found to have CaFMD as the only cause after a comprehensive work-up. CaFMD was diagnosed when computed tomographic angiography showed a bulbar spur without calcification.
Results - Twenty-five patients with stroke and CaFMD were identified. Computed tomographic angiography showed 2 CaFMD patterns: a thin (n=15) or thick (n=10) spur. Three patients initial computed tomographic angiography images showed a mural thrombus overlying the CaFMD. CaFMD was surgically removed from 7 of 25 and 20 of 25 patients who received antiplatelet therapy; after mean follow-up of 25.3±19.5 months, their respective recurrence rates were 0% and 30%.
Conclusions - CaFMD could be a common condition in young Afro-Caribbeans with carotid-territory ischemic stroke. Recurrences were frequent under antiplatelet treatment, while surgical CaFMD removal seemed more effective.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of a specific shape and a navigating method of microcatheters are suitable for placement at paraclinoid aneurysms. METHODS: The clinical data from 122 patients with 132 paraclinoid aneurysms that underwent endovascular treatments during a 2.5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Microcatheter shapes were classified as "straight," "primary curves" (45, 90, and J), "preshaped-C," "pigtail" (simple, right, and left), and "S" (simple, right, left, and preshaped). The navigating methods were classified as antegrade/retrograde microcatheter shift, wire-steering, looping, and coil/wire guiding. The shapes and navigating methods were compared among 3 aneurysm groups, which were categorized as superior, medial, and other, based on direction. RESULTS: Shapes were significantly different between the 3 groups; the most commonly engaged shape in the superior group, medial group, and other group was S (55%), pigtail (60%), and primary (56%), respectively. The straight and S shapes were used in 5 (83%) and 18 (86%) cases, respectively, in the superior group, whereas the pigtail shape was used in 50 (86%) cases in the medial group. Aside from pigtail-simple shape, the side of pigtail, right vs left, coincided with the side of the internal carotid artery involved in every case of the medial group. The navigating methods were not significantly different among the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: A specific shape by paraclinoid aneurysm direction tends to be suitable for the first trial of microcatheter shapes. Operators may reduce unnecessary struggling time of intra-aneurysmal placement of microcatheters by practicing the use of that shape.

abstract = {OBJECT: The scientific understanding of the nature of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the brain is evolving. It is clear from current work that AVMs can undergo a variety of phenomena, including growth, remodeling, and/or regression-and the responsible processes are both molecular and physiological. A review of these complex processes is critical to directing future therapeutic approaches. The authors performed a comprehensive review of the literature to evaluate current information regarding the genetics, pathophysiology, and behavior of AVMs. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed to reveal the angioarchitecture and cerebral hemodynamics of AVMS as they relate to lesion development. RESULTS: Feeding artery pressures, brain AVM compartmentalization, venous drainage, flow phenomena, and vascular steal are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic nature of brain AVMs is at least in part attributable to hemodynamic and flow-related phenomena. These forces acting on an evolving structure are critical to understanding the challenges in endovascular and surgical therapy. As knowledge in this field continues to progress, the natural history and predicted behavior of these AVMs will become more clearly elucidated.},

abstract = {We describe a 47-year-old female patient with a carotid web and ischemic stroke. A carotid web is a membrane-like shelf of tissue, predominantly affecting the intimal layer of the arterial wall, usually extending from the posterolateral wall of the carotid artery into the lumen, typically at the origin of the internal carotid artery just beyond the bifurcation. It is considered to be an under-recognized etiology of ischemic stroke in young and middle-aged patients. Typically, these patients do not show any coexistent or only few vascular risk factors. Digital subtraction angiography, computer tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and color-coded duplex sonography are able to identify carotid webs. Therapy strategies include conservative therapy with intake of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, or carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. Optimal therapy strategy remains open. A considerable rate of recurrent cerebrovascular ischemic events has been reported in patients with a symptomatic carotid web and conservative therapy. More data are needed on prevalence, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of patients with an asymptomatic or a symptomatic carotid web.Subject Codes: [13] Cerebrovascular Disease/Stroke, [44] Acute Cerebral Infarction, [193] Clinical Studies},

Decisions regarding management of AVMs are based on the expected natural history of the lesion and risk prediction for peritreatment morbidity. Microsurgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and endovascular embolization alone or in combination are all viable treatment options, each with different risks. The authors attempt to clarify the existing literature′s understanding of the natural history of intracranial AVMs, and risk-assessment grading scales for each of the three treatment modalities. Methods: The authors conducted a literature review of the existing AVM natural history studies and studies that clarify the utility of existing grading scales available for the assessment of peritreatment risk for all three treatment modalities. Results: The authors systematically outline the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with intracranial AVMs and clarify estimation of the expected natural history and predicted risk of treatment for intracranial AVMs. Conclusion: AVMs are a heterogenous pathology with three different options for treatment. Accurate assessment of risk of observation and risk of treatment is essential for achieving the best outcome for each patient.},

We reviewed evidence-based medicine and clinical experience with radiosurgery for AVM of the brain to develop guidelines and provide scientific foundation for patients and physicians. Major recommendations include the definition of AVM patients suitable for various management strategies ranging from observation to surgical excision to endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery. The optimal dose range for volumetric conformal AVM stereotactic radiosurgery has been largely established based on location and volume of the AVM. The relationship to prior embolization or prior surgery has been evaluated. The role of repeat radiosurgery has been assessed for those patients with incomplete obliteration of their AVM after 3 years have elapsed. The causes of failure of stereotactic radiosurgery have also been identified. A clinical algorithm for the potential role of stereotactic radiosurgery for a symptomatic brain AVM was defined. The guidelines provide a framework for professional judgment and treatment selection alternatives. {\textcopyright} 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract = {Background: Whether carotid artery web can be considered as a potential source of arterial thromboembolism in ischemic stroke remains uncertain. Aims: In a large sample of individuals with large intracranial artery occlusion, we compared the prevalence of carotid artery webs between patients with and without embolic stroke of undetermined source. Methods: In a single-center study of consecutive patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke referred for mechanical thrombectomy, the presence of carotid artery web was systematically assessed by two independent readers. Thereafter, its prevalence was compared between patients with and without embolic stroke of undetermined source. Results: Among 466 patients of whom 12% were considered to have had an embolic stroke of undetermined source, ipsilateral carotid artery web was detected in 1.9% (confidence interval 95% = 0.7–3.1). Ipsilateral carotid artery web was more frequent in embolic stroke of undetermined source than in the rest of the sample (10.7% (confidence interval 95% = 2.7–18.7] vs. 0.7% (0–1.5), P < 0.001). This difference remains significant after adjustment for sex, age, and vascular risk factor (odds ratio: 12.5 (2.1–72), P = 0.005) or after exclusion of patients with any other bulb wall thickening (P = 0.025). In contrast, the difference of prevalence of contralateral carotid artery web between the two groups did not reach statistical significance (2.4% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.6). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the presence of a carotid artery web might be considered as a potential source of large intracranial artery embolism. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess the exact risk of recurrence associated with these lesions.},

abstract = {Background Liquid embolic agents are the preferred embolic material in endovascular treatment of pial and brain arteriovenous malformations and dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs). There is little choice available in interventional neuroradiology practice other than two of the most commonly used liquid embolic agents-n-butyl cyanoacrylate and the Onyx liquid embolic system (ev3 Neurovascular, Irvine, California, USA). PHIL (Precipitating Hydrophobic Injectable Liquid) (Microvention, Inc California, USA) is a new liquid embolic agent, CE marked and available for clinical use in Europe. Objective To present our preliminary experience using PHIL in treating cranial and spinal DAVFs. Methods Between September 2014 and January 2015, eight patients, with five cranial DAVFs and three spinal DAVFs were treated with PHIL as the sole embolic agent used with intent to cure. Clinical presentation, location of DAVF, Borden type, fluoroscopic time, radiation dose, procedural time, injecting microcatheter used, volume of PHIL injected, complications, immediate angiographic data, premorbid and discharge modified Rankin Scale score, and any neurologic deficits were included in the analysis. Results Seven patients were successfully treated with complete angiographic exclusion of the fistula in a single sitting. Treatment failed in one patient where only suboptimal microcatheter positioning could be achieved and PHIL failed to penetrate the fistula's nidus. Venous penetration was achieved in all other patients except one with a small fistula, but with adequate fistula penetration by the embolic material. No other technical complication or neurologic deterioration occurred in any of the patients. Conclusions PHIL liquid embolic agent appears to be an excellent alternative embolic material with certain advantages compared with other available liquid embolic agents. Further studies are required to fully evaluate its safety and efficacy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient age, hemorrhagic presentation, nidal diffuseness, and deep perforating artery supply are important factors when selecting patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) for surgery. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that these factors outside of the Spetzler-Martin grading system could be combined into a simple, supplementary grading system that would accurately predict neurologic outcome and refine patient selection. METHODS: A consecutive, single-surgeon series of 300 patients with AVMs treated microsurgically was analyzed in terms of change between preoperative and final postoperative modified Rankin Scale scores. Three different multivariable logistic models (full, Spetzler-Martin, and supplementary models) were constructed to test the association of combined predictor variables with the change in modified Rankin Scale score. A simplified supplementary grading system was developed from the data with points assigned according to each variable and added together for a supplementary AVM grade. RESULTS: Predictive accuracy was highest for the full multivariable model (receiver operating characteristic curve area, 0.78), followed by the supplementary model (0.73), and least for the Spetzler-Martin model (0.66). Predictive accuracy of the simplified supplementary grade was significantly better than that of the Spetzler-Martin grade (P = .042), with receiver operating characteristic curve areas of 0.73 and 0.65, respectively. CONCLUSION: This new AVM grading system supplements rather than replaces the well-established Spetzler-Martin grading system and is a better predictor of neurologic outcomes after AVM surgery. The supplementary grading scale has high predictive accuracy on its own and stratifies surgical risk more evenly. The supplementary grading system is easily applicable at the bedside, where it is intended to improve preoperative risk prediction and patient selection for surgery.

Endovascular therapies have helped to decrease operative morbidity by making it easier for the surgeon to resect the AVM and, in some cases, by eliminating the need for surgery altogether.

abstract = {Spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas (SEDAVFs) are rare complex lesions often presenting with protean clinical manifestations secondary to compressive symptoms or congestive myelopathy. The imaging manifestations of SEDAVFs on MR angiography/MRI include high T2 signal in the spinal cord, vascular engorgement of the epidural space, and prominent intradural vascular flow voids. Given the complexity of these lesions, they are best characterized anatomically on catheter angiography where careful inspection of arterial feeders and venous drainage patterns can be performed. The imaging hallmark of an SEDAVF on angiography is the presence of a dilated epidural venous pouch through which spinal and paraspinal veins are secondarily opacified. In the lower thoracic and lumbar spine, SEDAVFs are usually located in the ventral epidural space and fed mainly by the anteriorly coursing epidural arteries. In the cervical and upper thoracic spine, SEDAVFs and their feeding arteries are more typically located laterally in the spinal canal. Current treatment options include transarterial or transvenous endovascular embolization with liquid embolic agents or coils, and surgical resection/disconnection of the fistula. Further research is needed to better characterize how and why these lesions form and to identify the best treatment modalities.},

abstract = {Background: To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies on carotid webs with atherosclerosis plaque have been conducted. Thus, both radiologists and clinicians have insufficient knowledge of this disease, which could lead to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is beneficial to clinical management and prevention of stroke. Here, we present a case of a carotid web with an atherosclerotic plaque, which was confirmed by histopathology and was treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Case presentation: We report a rare case of a carotid web with an atherosclerotic plaque in a 61-year-old Han man. He presented to our hospital with history of intermittent dizziness and slurred speech for 1.5 years and numbness of both upper limbs for 4 months. A computed tomography angiography examination indicated severe stenosis at the beginning of the left internal carotid artery with plaque surface ulceration. Doppler ultrasound examination showed a carotid web with a thin isoechoic plaque and a membrane-like structure protruding into the lumen from the lateral posterior wall at the beginning of the left internal carotid artery. The thin isoechoic plaque could be seen at the base of the membrane-like structure. Carotid endarterectomy was performed to alleviate symptoms. A carotid web with atherosclerosis was diagnosed intraoperatively, and postoperative pathology confirmed extensive intima fibroid hyperplasia accompanied with myxoid degeneration. The base of the carotid web was attached to the thin atherosclerosis plaque, and between the web and the plaque, a cavity was observed. In this case report, we aim to discuss the diagnosis of carotid web with atherosclerosis, its physiopathology and management, and the possible reasons for missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Conclusion: Carotid webs with atherosclerosis have no known etiological factors and are rarely reported. Thus, carotid webs could be easily confused with ulcerations on the surface of the atherosclerosis plaque. The diagnosis could be difficult and effective management remains indeterminate. Moreover, prompt recognition of this disease is key to correct treatment and management. Hence, this case report and the relevant data in the literature could contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to describe 27 patients with 32 web vessels (WVs) from our practice and provide a review of the literature regarding imaging diagnostics, clinical presentation, and treatment of WVs. Methods: A MEDLINE search was performed using combinations of the following terms: “stroke in young adults,” “web,” “recurrent stroke,” “diaphragm-like,” “atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia,” “atypical fibromuscular dysplasia,” “septal fibromuscular dysplasia,” “septa,” “diaphragms,” “pseudovalvular folds,” and “carotid diaphragm.” Our series was added in this review. Results: According to location, there were 88 carotid WVs (91.66%), 7 vertebral WVs (7.3%), and 1 subclavian WV (1.04%). According to clinical presentation, the reported WVs caused stroke in 81 cases (84.38%). Treatment was supportive care in 46 cases (47.91%), surgery in 33 cases (35.41%), and an endovascular procedure through angioplasty and stenting in 17 cases (17.7%). Variables such as age (P = 0.7565), sex (P = 0.6912), and location (P = 0.7993) were not shown to be risk factors for stroke in these patients. Conclusions: Although few cases have been reported in the literature, the stroke rate in patients with WVs is high. Endovascular treatment is presented as an effective form of treatment with no associated morbidities or recurrences of ischemic events.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: Diaphragms of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries as a cause of ischaemic stroke are reported and stenting of diaphragms as a therapeutic option in stroke secondary prevention is described. Methods: Five patients were cared for in our institution from 2000 to 2011 for recurrent ischaemic strokes which were classified to be of undetermined aetiology after completion of the usual investigations. Because the patients had already had ischaemic strokes in the territory of the same artery, a conventional digital subtracted angiography was performed. A diaphragm was identified on the artery that supplied the territory in which the stroke occurred. The stroke was therefore attributed to the diaphragm. Clinical and radiological data, treatment and the clinical course of the patients was retrospectively reviewed. Results: The diaphragm was located in the vertebral artery in three cases and in the bulb of the internal carotid artery in two. In all cases cerebral MR showed ischaemic strokes of different ages downstream of the diaphragm. Stenting was performed in four cases. No patient had a symptomatic recurrent ischaemic event after stenting. Conclusions: Diaphragms are a rare cause of recurrent embolic strokes which are often not detected with non-invasive imaging. Stenting appears to be a therapeutic option in stroke secondary prevention. These observations suggest that conventional angiography should be performed in cases of recurrent ischaemic strokes in the territory of a single artery and in cases of ischaemic stroke of undetermined aetiology in young adults when the usual investigations are negative. {\textcopyright} 2014 EFNS.},

The best way to treat carotid web is debatable and carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been reported as a treatment for the carotid web in only a few case series. In this study we evaluate the safety and feasibility of CAS in symptomatic carotid webs and examined the histopathology of a carotid web. Materials and methods: At our institution between 2017 and 2019, 10 consecutive patients with symptomatic carotid webs were treated. We retrospectively analyzed the data for patient demographics, clinical presentation, imaging, treatment methodology and follow up. Results: All the patients had presented with ipsilateral embolic stroke. The mean age at presentation was 50 years (range 37–71) with seven female and three male patients. All patients underwent CAS except one patient who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA). In one stented patient, there was significant hypotension in the post-procedural period lasting a week. The patients were followed for a mean of 5.5 months (range one day-12 months). No recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred. Surgical pathological studies confirmed fibromuscular dysplasia in one specimen. Conclusion: In our experience CAS for carotid web is feasible and safe in patients presenting with ischemic embolic strokes.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose-Carotid webs have been increasingly recognized as a cause of recurrent stroke, but evidence remains scarce. We aim to report the clinical outcomes and first series of carotid stenting in a cohort of patients with strokes from symptomatic carotid webs. Methods-Prospective and consecutive data of patients <65 years old with cryptogenic stroke admitted within September 2014 to May 2017. Carotid web was defined by a shelf-like/linear filling defect in the posterior internal carotid artery bulb by computed tomographic angiography. Results-Twenty-four patients were identified (91.6% strokes/8.4% transient ischemic attacks [TIAs]). Median age was 46 (41-59) years, 61% were female, and 75% were black. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10.5 (3.0-16.0) and ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) was 8 (7-8). There were no parenchymal hemorrhages, and 96% of patients were independent at 3 months. All webs caused <50% stenosis. In patients with bilateral webs (58%), median ipsilateral web length was larger than contralateral (3.1 [3.0-4.5] mm versus 2.6 [1.85-2.9] mm; P=0.01), respectively. Twenty-nine percent of patients had thrombus superimposed on the symptomatic carotid web. A recurrent stroke/TIA involving the territory of the previously symptomatic web occurred in 7 (32%; 6 strokes/1 TIA) patients: 3 <1 week, 2 <first year, and 3 >1 year of follow-up. Two recurrences occurred on dual antiplatelet therapy, 3 on antiplatelet monotherapy, 1 within 24 hours of thrombolysis, and 1 off antithrombotics. Median follow-up was 12.2 (8.0- 18.0) months. Sixteen (66%) patients were stented at a median 12.2 (7.0-18.7) days after stroke with no periprocedural complications. No recurrent strokes/TIAs occurred in stented individuals (median follow-up of 4 [2.4-12.0] months). Conclusions-Carotid web is associated with high recurrent stroke/TIA risk, despite antithrombotic use, and is amenable to carotid stenting.},

abstract = {Background: A carotid web (CaW) is a shelf-like lesion in the posterior aspect of the internal carotid bulb and represents an intimal variant of fibromuscular dysplasia. CaW has been associated with recurrent strokes and conventionally treated with surgical excision. We report a multicenter experience of stenting in patients with symptomatic CaWs. Methods: Retrospective review of consecutive patients admitted to 5 comprehensive stroke centers who were identified to have a symptomatic CaW and treated with carotid stenting. A symptomatic CaW was defined by the presence of a shelf-like/linear, smooth filling defect in the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb diagnosed by neck CT angiography (CTA) and confirmed with conventional angiography in patients with negative stroke workup. Results: Twenty-four patients with stented symptomatic CaW were identified (stroke in 83% and transient ischemic attack in 17%). Their median age was 47 years (IQR 41-61), 14 (58%) were female, and were 17 (71%) black. The degree of stenosis by NASCET was 0% (range 0-11). All patients were placed on dual antiplatelets and stented at a median of 9 days (IQR 4-35) after the last event. Closed-cell stents were used in 18 (75%) of the cases. No periprocedural events occurred with the exception of 2 cases of asymptomatic hypotension/bradycardia. Clinical follow-up after stent placement occurred for a median of 12 months (IQR 3-19) with no new cerebrovascular events noted. Functional independence at 90 days was achieved in 22 (91%) patients. Follow-up vascular imaging (ultrasound n = 18/CTA n = 5) was performed at a median of 10 months (IQR 3-18) and revealed no stenosis.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Atypical fibromuscular dysplasia (AFMD), also known as carotid web, is  a rare underdiagnosed shelf-like fibrous tissue arising from the posterior carotid artery bulb that is a cause of cryptogenic stroke of the anterior cerebral vascularization. Despite the recurrence and severity of strokes caused by embolization associated with AFMD, there are no recommendations on the best strategy to manage single and bilateral lesions, which have unsatisfactory outcomes when treated with medical treatment exclusively. METHODS: From January 2016 to April 2019, 365 patients were operated on for a carotid stenosis in our institution. This cohort included 11 patients (3%), with a median age of 41 years (39-51 years), referred by a stroke unit, treated for a symptomatic (10 strokes and 1 recurrent TIA) AFMD lesion. Pre-operative workup revealed a contralateral similar lesion in 45 % of patients (5/11), which all also underwent surgery during a subsequent hospitalization. The diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination when open surgery was performed. 30-day and 1-year outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 16 AFMD lesions operated: 13 were treated by open surgery (2 by classic endarterectomy and 11 by internal carotid resection-anastomosis) and 3 by carotid artery stenting, respectively with a mean delay of 85.5 days and 20.5 days following the lastest stroke. There was one complication following stenting (external iliac rupture) that was treated by a covered stent, and no peri operative complication following open surgery. The follow-up at 30 days and one year was uneventful for all patients, without any deaths nor stroke recurrences. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic AFMD is a rare cause of cryptogenic stroke. Bilateral lesions are frequent. Early intervention is associated with favorable peri operative and one-year outcomes. Open surgery is the first line therapeutic option in this young patient population.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose-Carotid web (CW) is a rare form of focal fibromuscular dysplasia defined as an abnormal shelflike projection of intimal fibrous tissue into the carotid bulb. It is theorized that CW leads to ischemic stroke secondary to blood flow stasis and subsequent embolization. The natural history and optimal management of CW are unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of CW. Methods-Our librarians performed a SLR for CW and related terminology. Patient-level demographics, stroke risk factors, neuroimaging findings, stroke recurrence or stroke free-duration, and treatment modality were extracted. We used descriptive statistics to characterize our results. When specific patient-level metrics were not reported, the denominators for reporting percentage calculations were adjusted accordingly. Results-Our literature search produced 1150 articles. Thirty-seven articles including 158 patients (median age 46 years [range 16-85], 68% women, 76% symptomatic) met entry criteria and were included in our SLR. Of the symptomatic CW patients: 57% did not have stroke risk factors, 56% who received medical therapy had recurrent stroke (median 12 months, range 0-97), and 72% were ultimately treated with carotid revascularization (50% carotid stenting, 50% carotid endarterectomy). There were no periprocedural complications or recurrent strokes in carotid revascularization patients. Conclusions-CW leads to ischemic stroke in younger patients without conventional stroke risk factors. We found a high stroke recurrence rate in medically managed symptomatic CW patients, whereas carotid revascularization effectively prevented recurrent stroke. Our findings should be interpreted with caution because of risk of publication and reporting bias.},

abstract = {Objective: Antegrade femoral artery access is often used for ipsilateral infrainguinal peripheral vascular intervention. However, the use of closure devices (CD) for antegrade access (AA) is still considered outside the instructions for use for most devices. We hypothesized that CD use for antegrade femoral access would not be associated with an increased odds of access site complications. Methods: The Vascular Quality Initiative was queried from 2010 to 2019 for infrainguinal peripheral vascular interventions performed via femoral AA. Patients who had a cutdown or multiple access sites were excluded. Cases were then stratified into whether a CD was used or not. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regressions controlling for hospital-level variation were used to examine the independent association between CD use and access site complications. A sensitivity analysis using coarsened exact matching was performed using factors different between treatment groups to reduce imbalance between the groups. Results: Overall, 11,562 cases were identified and 5693 (49.2%) used a CD. Patients treated with a CD were less likely to be white (74.1% vs 75.2%), have coronary artery disease (29.7% vs 33.4%), use aspirin (68.7% vs 72.4%), and have heparin reversal with protamine (15.5% vs 25.6%; all P <.05). CD patients were more likely to be obese (31.6% vs 27.0%), have an elective operation (82.6% vs 80.1%), ultrasound-guided access (75.5% vs 60.6%), and a larger access sheath (6.0 ± 1.0 F vs 5.5 ± 1.0 F; P <.05 for all). CD cases were less likely to develop any access site hematoma (2.55% vs 3.53%; P <.01) or a hematoma requiring reintervention (0.63% vs 1.26%; P <.01) and had no difference in access site stenosis or occlusion (0.30% vs 0.22%; P =.47) compared with no CD. On multivariable analysis, CD cases had significantly decreased odds of developing any access site hematoma (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.95) and a hematoma requiring intervention (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.81). A sensitivity analysis after coarsened exact matching confirmed these findings. Conclusions: In this nationally representative sample, CD use for AA was associated with a lower odds of hematoma in selected patients. Extending the instructions for use indications for CDs to include femoral AA may decrease the incidence of access site complications, patient exposure to reintervention, and costs to the health care system.},

It is clear from current work that AVMs can undergo a variety of phenomena, including growth, remodeling, and/or regression-and the responsible processes are both molecular and physiological. A review of these complex processes is critical to directing future therapeutic approaches. The authors performed a comprehensive review of the literature to evaluate current information regarding the genetics, pathophysiology, and behavior of AVMs. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed to reveal the molecular biology of AVMs as it relates to their complex growth and behavior patterns. Results: Growth factors involved in AVMs include vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, angiopoietins, fibronectin, laminin, integrin, and matrix metalloproteinases. Conclusions Understanding the complicated molecular milieu of developing AVMs is essential for defining their natural history. Growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and other molecular markers will be the key to unlocking novel targeted drug treatments for these brain malformations.},

abstract = {Objective: Endovascular treatment using Onyx has been increasingly used to treat intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs). This study evaluated predictive factors for favorable treatment outcome in patients with intracranial noncavernous DAVFs treated by transarterial Onyx embolization. Methods: Between August 2008 and August 2014, 55 patients who underwent transarterial Onyx embolization for noncavernous DAVFs were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' demographic, clinical, and procedural data were analyzed to find statistically significant predictive factors for favorable treatment outcomes after Onyx embolization. Fistulas were classified angiographically according to the relationship between fistulas and dural venous sinuses and the presence of leptomeningeal venous reflux. Results: Sixty-eight Onyx embolizations were performed in 55 patients. Immediate angiographic cure was achieved in 28 patients, and 14 of 27 patients with residual shunts showed progressive occlusion at follow-up imaging studies. Therefore, the overall favorable treatment outcome was 76.4% (42/55). The remaining 13 patients (23.6%) showed persistent residual shunts, and 3 (5.5%) of them showed aggravation of residual lesion on follow-up studies. Of 25 patients with non-sinus fistulas, 23 patients (92%) showed favorable treatment outcomes, and 19 of 30 patients (63.3%) with sinus fistulas showed favorable outcomes. Among the evaluated variables, non-sinus DAVFs was a statistically significant predictive factor for favorable response to transarterial Onyx embolization (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Transarterial Onyx embolization is a highly effective treatment method for non-sinus DAVFs. Careful consideration of angiographic features and multimodal embolization strategies are required for treatment of sinus DAVFs.},
