In addition, it has a standard luer lock hub at the proximal end, and a radiopaque marker at the steam-shapeable distal tip.

They are named similarly to other sheaths (e.g. groin or radial) - i.e. after their INNER diameter. Hence a \"6 french\" shuttle is actually 8 french on the outside. Guide catheters, such as the Benchmark, are named after their OUTER diameter. Hence a \"6 french\" Benchmark is 6 french on the outside.

A DMSO compatible delivery microcatheter that is indicated for use in the neuro vasculature (e.g. MarathonTM, RebarTM or UltraFlowTM HPC catheters) is used to access the embolization site. Onyx is available in two product formulations, Onyx 18(6% EVOH) and Onyx 34 (8% EVOH). Onyx 18 will travel more distally and penetrate deeper into the nidus due to its lower viscosity compared to Onyx 34. Final solidification occurs within five minutes for both product formulations. Onyx is delivered by slow controlled injection through a micro catheter into the brain arteriovenous malformation under fluoroscopic control.

previous Pipeline stents it does not need to be \"dragged and dropped\" but can instead be unsheathed at the desired location. The distal end should open without a resheathing maneuvre as the PFTE sleeve direction have been reversed. Unsheathing is recommended to be performed mostly by pushing on the wire and recentering when necessary (by reducing load on the microcatheter). In tortuous bends it may be useful to load the system (by applying force to the microcatheter and wire) to open the braids. This may also have the effect of compacting the braid (if constrained). Resheathing should be achieved first by removing load from the system - this can be achieved by pulling the microcatheter and wire together. Next put slight forward pressure on the microcatheter and mostly pull the delivery wire. Note: the point of no return is the distal end of the resheathing marker. The device can be resheathed until the resheathing marker has reached the distal marker of the microcatheter. the system is designed to allow for 2 full cycles of resheathing.","recommended":"Phenom 21","material":"Either 48 or 64 cobalt chromium wires with platinum on the inside of each wire (drawn filled tube configuration).

previous Pipeline stents it does not need to be \"dragged and dropped\" but can instead be unsheathed at the desired location. The distal end should open without a resheathing maneuvre as the PFTE sleeve direction have been reversed. Unsheathing is recommended to be performed mostly by pushing on the wire and recentering when necessary (by reducing load on the microcatheter). In tortuous bends it may be useful to load the system (by applying force to the microcatheter and wire) to open the braids. This may also have the effect of compacting the braid (if constrained). Resheathing should be achieved first by removing load from the system - this can be achieved by pulling the microcatheter and wire together. Next put slight forward pressure on the microcatheter and mostly pull the delivery wire. Note: the point of no return is the distal end of the resheathing marker. The device can be resheathed until the resheathing marker has reached the distal marker of the microcatheter. the system is designed to allow for 2 full cycles of resheathing.","recommended":"Phenom 27","material":"Either 48 or 64 cobalt chromium wires with platinum on the inside of each wire (drawn filled tube configuration).

The Comaneci can be used partly unsheathed if the entire length is not required. There is a distal wire tip extending beyond the expandable mesh - this enables the Comaneci to be positioned more distally, or pulled back, after unsheathing. If, however, the device is to be moved across a tight curve or a significant distance it is recommended to resheath fully inside the microcatheter first. </p>\n<p> Draw the yellow slider on the Comaneci's handle back to open the device slowly click by click. Do not over expand the device. You may apply forward pressure on the microcatheter to bulge the Comaneci in to the aneurysm. It is possible to use 2 Comaneci together for wide neck bifurcation aneurysms (\"\"Comaneci Kissing Technique\"\"). Push the yellow slider forward to constrain the device. This is important to intermittently check for coil herniation. </p>\n<p>It is recommended that the coiling microcatheter is retrieved whilst the Comaneci is open. When this has been achieved then close the Comaneci completely and resheath it before removing the Comaneci microcatheter. </p>","stent diameter mm":2.5,"stent length mm":22},{"type":"Stent Retriever","name":"Tigertriever","manufacturer":"Rapid Medical","url1":"https://web.archive.org/web/20201203224140/https://www.rapid-medical.com/tigertriever","minid":0,"maxod":0.02,"length":"?","design":"braided","stent length mm":32},{"type":"Stent Retriever","name":"Tigertriever 17","manufacturer":"Rapid Medical","url1":"https://web.archive.org/web/20201203224140/https://www.rapid-medical.com/tigertriever","minid":0,"maxod":0.0165,"length":"?","design":"braided","stent length mm":23},{"type":"Stent Retriever","name":"Tigertriever 13","manufacturer":"Rapid Medical","url1":"https://web.archive.org/web/20201203224140/https://www.rapid-medical.com/tigertriever","minid":0,"maxod":0.012,"length":"?","design":"braided","stent length mm":20.5},{"type":"Stent Retriever","name":"Tigertriever XL","manufacturer":"Rapid Medical","url1":"https://web.archive.org/web/20201203224140/https://www.rapid-medical.com/tigertriever","minid":0,"maxod":0.02,"length":"?","design":"braided","stent length mm":53},{"type":"Wire","name":"Columbus","manufacturer":"Rapid Medical","url1":"https://www.rapid-medical.com/columbus","minid":0,"maxod":0.014,"length":"?"},{"type":"Balloon","name":"Transform C & SC: 3, 4, 5, 6 mm","manufacturer":"Stryker","url1":"https://www.strykerneurovascular.com/us/products/hemorrhagic/transform-occlusion-balloon-catheter","minid":0.015,"maxod":0.037,"length":"150","comments":"Single lumen balloon.

The length should be determined by provision of over 4 mm coverage on both sides of the neck of the aneurysm (if used for stent coiling). \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe stent must be flushed prior to use by inserting the tip of the stent sheath in to the middle of the RHV valve and waiting for saline to drip back. Do not tighten the valve too much during this maneuvre as you may damage the stent.

The BOBBY Balloon Guide Catheter incorporates a compliant balloon, radiopaque markers, and a bifurcated luer hub on the proximal end. The BOBBY Balloon Guide Catheter has an inner lumen through which a guidewire and catheter can be inserted, and a co-axial outer lumen that is used to inflate and deflate the balloon with a syringe filled with contrast media. A bifurcated luer hub is attached to the proximal end of the balloon guide catheter to provide access to both the inner and outer lumens. In addition, a hydrophilic coating is applied to the distal end of the balloon guide catheter to provide a lubricious outer surface for catheter advancement in the vasculature. A compliant balloon is mounted on the distal end to provide temporary vascular occlusion during angiographic procedures. The balloon incorporates a distal air-purging system to purge air from the inflation lumen prior to use.
